Kyle
So just to confirm,

Simon Cullen
Do I have your permission to record this interview?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. All right. Terrific.

Simon Cullen
I am going to just start off with some background questions. They're pretty boring, but we'll get on to some interesting stuff soon. So what state are you currently working in?

Unknown Speaker
California? Okay.

Simon Cullen
How's it going over there? You

Kyle
guys still on fire? Not that

Unknown Speaker
I heard of, but I'm also ignoring the news at the moment.

Simon Cullen
Could be important for one Saturday these days. Okay, so what is the highest level of education you've

Unknown Speaker
reached so far? Bachelor's? Okay.

Simon Cullen
And for how many years? Have you been working with clients?

Unknown Speaker
A year? Over a year and a half now?

Simon Cullen
Okay. And where do you deliver therapy?

Unknown Speaker
Home Study school settings at the clinic.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, great.

Simon Cullen
What credentials do you hold from? BAC B?

Unknown Speaker
RBT. Registered behavior technician?

Kyle
Okay, do you have any plans to become a BCBA? Not currently no. Okay. All right.

Simon Cullen
So like I mentioned, one thing we are definitely interested in is whether or not arbitrators are treated and paid fairly for the work that they do. So if you don't mind my asking, What was your starting salary in your very first position?

Unknown Speaker
Legally? The minimum 16 Okay.

Kyle
Did you receive health insurance? Oh, no, I do work part time. That could be why. Okay, and what is your current salary?

Unknown Speaker
My current salary is now $19.

Simon Cullen
Okay, and you currently also don't have health insurance through your work?

Unknown Speaker
How many hours a week do you work in total? 21. Okay.

Simon Cullen
And considering just an average client, how many hours would you work with him?

Kyle
Two or three?

Simon Cullen
And how many clients you're working with now?

Unknown Speaker
For? Okay,

Simon Cullen
so that would, that would be sort of eight to 12 hours a week. So you said you were doing 21 hours with all

Kyle
what was that? So

Unknown Speaker
it's very weird with my scheduling right now. So you see before because like, a lot of them change the time last minute for me. And, like, even I have for clients, I have them for like, five days a week, we switch off. So like to class on me for three days a week. And then the other two is like on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So

Simon Cullen
do you get paid when people cancel? Yeah.

Kyle
Yeah, I've heard that a lot. That must be pretty difficult. Alright. Wow.

Simon Cullen
So you're getting really quite a lot of cancellations then?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. All right.

Simon Cullen
I'm gonna ask you more about that in a bit. So considering an average client from when he starts at the clinic, how many months or years will he spend getting treatment before he graduates from the clinic? To be

Unknown Speaker
honest, I don't really know the information about that. I don't really work at the clinic anymore. I requested to be off from working because the commute is too far for me personally. Okay.

Simon Cullen
So we've certainly noticed that many RBTs tell us that turnover at the clinic is very high. Do you have a sense of, on average, how many years RBT stay at the clinic where you were, where you last worked, or any of the clinics where you have worked.

Unknown Speaker
From what I've noticed, I've seen people stay average six months, I have met a few people, maybe mainly supervisors take like three months. I know their supervisors. At least for Microsoft clinic, there's a contract where after they get the BCBA, they have to stay with the company for like 18 months until they can leave the company. But nothing really enforces them to stay.

Simon Cullen
So considering everywhere you have worked, would you say that the level of turnover is or turnover and burnout is concerning?

Kyle
Yeah, I would say so.

Simon Cullen
We've heard that from a lot of people. I'm curious what you think might explain the level of turnover or burnout?

Unknown Speaker
Well, to be honest, to work as a behavior interventionist, is considered entry level. So a lot of people go in here for quick cash or have a job while having flexibility for school or work hours from other places. So they're not really as like committed to stay for whatever personal reasons that we have, in addition, made the clients that we do work with can be described as difficult or on the more severe end of autism. And many people feel like they didn't sign up for that. Or again, maybe due to improper training or not enough experience. It's, you know, it contributes a lot to the burnout. And the frustrations that are often felt in this company definitely has to do with the pay raise here. From my personal experience, I had to ask people around me and be like, how much do you pay? Are you paid, and then a lot of my coworkers at the time had to, like, put me into a separate room, look around, close the door and be like, we can't talk about that here. And I was like, Well, why not? Cuz for me personally, I was just like, I think I have the right to ask that I know, professionally, maybe not. But that's just how I am personally, it's like, I just wanted to know, like, how am I being fairly compensated here, because one, I was alright. I, at the time, I was a psychology major. And like, I was interested in this, I was like, this is something that I am, you know, kind of passionate in. So like, everyone else around me is kind of like, not really in for the site feel. So they're just getting, you know, getting by. And to my surprise, I've learned that everyone else was making so much more than me, or just more than me, like 1750 1921. And they were people, I think, the most heartbreaking for me when I, the moment I realized, like, I have to find a different, at least company outside of this was when I learned that there were new hires being paid 24, which is $2 higher than what is supposed to be the maximum you can get at an entry level job. Yeah, so I was very, like, heartbroken to hear about that. Especially given I'm sorry, I don't want to cry. But like cuz I think when talking to my area manager about this, I was just saying, like, hey, like, when I first applied to this job, it was advertised at $22 an hour, there was no ash or anything like that, like it was just, you know, it sounded like a great deal. And when I got hired, I was told, because of my lack of experience in this field, I only get 16. I tried to fight it, but very, you know, they were very firm 16, I was like, you know, what, I need experience, I need something. And like, maybe I can make something out of this. And so to learn that there are new hires in from my co workers for it's not like, and I never met the new hires. But they were apparently terrible at the job. They didn't. I think they started like 23. And they offer $1 Extra, and it's still left within like, two months or whatever. And so you know, like, hear that. And then, for me, I'm my company. I don't like

Unknown Speaker
I

Unknown Speaker
don't want to brag or anything like that. But like, I have been an employee at the month, two times in a row already. I've been revered and praised by my supervisors, they see my effort and my love for this work, my love for my clients, like, even, you know, even my most typical clients like I have, they seen it all, you know, so I told them, I was just like, it just wouldn't have been nice to have the same level of respect to be reflected onto my paycheck.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, what do you think,

Simon Cullen
seems really seems like a very bad situation.

Unknown Speaker
I think they understood where I was coming from, especially my area manager at the time, I do have to promise those that the area manager that I was speaking to, recently got squished in by someone else. So the one that I had, like a relationship already that she knew about me, I was hoping to talk to her, but then I had to talk to someone new. So I very much promise a conversation be like, This is not how I want our first conversation to go, however, like you're gonna receive the back end, and they were very understanding of it. It's kind of like a whole, like, you know, HR kind of statement being like, oh, like we understand, but like, I'm not the one person in charge of this, we have to talk to the higher ups. And, you know, I need to like, maybe I could have fought harder, maybe I should stand more firmly. But the same time it's just like, I'm not going to take my anger on someone who doesn't deserve to, you know, hear that. And at the end, I did get like $2 Extra, not what I wanted, but still it's just kind of like when I kind of told myself I was like okay, I should start looking for somewhere else though, because I know in the long run this place isn't really for me, which is a shame because I genuinely do love like my clients. I love my supervisors. The work environment is one of the healthiest I've just because the amount of like emotional support I've been here like there is like the payoff to that you see with your kids like there I had one kid nonverbal but sorry going on tangent.

Simon Cullen
Please, this is why we're talking today and Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker
was just like, you know, quite honestly, he was a very typical client, he hated me. And I was just like, I hate you too, but we're gonna work together. And then one day, their father came in, and they're like, with the AAC device, you know, the little talker, like they said, like, their first sentence. And like, it was like, he never worked on sentence before until I started working with him. So it was very much like my contribution there. And my supervisor, she knew I was having a very difficult time with him, like I was very much. And this is when I had to continue very far. So I was kind of like, you know, kind of, like pain by thread. So when we said our goodbyes, like, I just started crying, because it just like, felt like such a huge payoff. And so, my supervisor, Krishnan, she's like, chained yourself to Starbucks, like, you are like, in here for a reason, like, you don't see your impact or like your worth outside of like, the, like, immediate environment, but like, you are doing incredible things here, but never really pressure me to stay either. Like, again, the environment is so nice here. It's just such a shame that like, we can't be fairly compensated, at least for the employees that have been the most loyal to working at this current company. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
yeah. Wow.

Simon Cullen
So I'm thinking back to the question I asked you minutes ago, do you have any plans to become a BCBA? And you said, No. And yet, here you are expressing some kind of like very deep reward that you've experienced from working, albeit in ideal circumstances. But I'm curious, then, what's going on there?

Unknown Speaker
Well, during my short time, here at my current company, there's been a lot of supervisors leaving. And to be honest, like, I can only tell you so much that action alone of just them moving on with their lives, whether they still be a BCBA, or somewhere else, or move on to a different chapter. But when I asked personally, some of my supervisors, like one of them was, you know, a bi before, nice to work with them. And then it came supervisor must pass. And I finally caught up with him say, so like, how's it like, the supervisor must be so much fun. And then they're like, oh, not really, oh, like, oh, like, do tell. And they're just saying, like, they miss the interaction of the to the kids, what made the job so worthwhile. Everything's just like data books, or like, again, doing things outside of their job description, such as, like calling insurance companies, because insurance companies here are like the most headaches, because there's constant like updates or like, testing or something with insurance companies changing their policies, there's times where, simply because the insurance alone wasn't accepted in our company, we had to cut ties with so many clients. And it's heartbreaking to like, tell the parents and the kids, like, we can't provide services for you anymore. And like, you can only imagine, like, the consequences that can happen to the kid for not having the everyday like, you know, intervention needed for their improvement. And so, also, for me, personally, maybe it's me, slightly holding a grudge. But when I talked to my area manager about the whole getting a pay raise, and only getting $2 in return. In a way it felt like they were kind of gatekeeping me to stay here, because they told me if I do want the two additional dollars, I could agree to become like a supervisor and become an intern of the program and start off from there. And for me, I was just like, $30 Extra to commit two years of my life any a master's, that wasn't really my intended goal. That doesn't seem worthwhile to me. And I became really close to some of my supervisors, the most amazing people I've ever met. And they told me to they're like, yeah, like, even like, you know, there's some people who are supervisors, quite similar to my situation, like, who aren't really good at their job or don't do much at the clinic. And yet, they're paid so much more than them. And so, to me, I'm just kind of like, I don't really want to be stuck in a place just because I'm comfortable or like complacent with it.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, that

Simon Cullen
makes a lot of sense. I mean, obviously, they're difficult decisions in their given regions, but I understand that. Generally speaking, do you feel respected at your current clinic?

Unknown Speaker
I do. Yes. Um, regardless of the paycheck, I understand that it's something outside of my like area, even when hiring managers. Yes, that is completely out of our control. So when I do see her, you know, it's always with the utmost respect with the most like love and care, I think opposite anyone else. I think it just goes to show like we have to acknowledge it is the higher ups is their word, and it's very apparent that they don't show up much consideration for those who are the foundation of the company.

Simon Cullen
Do you know anything about who the sort of owners or directors of the clinic are or what their backgrounds are?

Unknown Speaker
No, but to be honest, is because I don't care enough to search them. Yeah, because I've heard stories too about other things that, you know, they meet executive decisions where before, for example, we used to have two front desk ladies. And the two fortunately, if they don't do just admin stuff, they take care of like scheduling for other people to take care of cancellations. Like they hold the whole clinic together. They deserve the most love and everything. However, the higher ups made and it's likely a decision to fire one of them, because they want to hold a PR marketing thing where one front desk lady will look very nice for I don't know, I said reasons. But it's, yeah, and it was just so heartbreaking. Because they just sent her an email be like, yeah, so two weeks from now is your last day and then you can get your paycheck. And she broke down crying. And she was she just quit on the spot. She was just like, by and it sucks too, because for other practice lady, she is like, literally a rock. Now she's like, overwhelmed with so much more responsibility for before I least it was somewhat evenly distributed. And like she can't even she doesn't want to stay. But she has to just to get money under the table for like, you know, for her own kids for her own health insurance. But you can tell that like, like, when she had at least the other contests lady like she was at least glowing. She was like, okay, like getting through the day being like her sassy little self. Now she's like, good. I like doesn't want to be here trying to find a different job. Yeah. Wow.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so you worked at a different clinic before this one

Unknown Speaker
is that I have. This is my first clinic. I have other friends a lot. A lot of RBTs in the area that work for me. So I heard their stories. And to be honest, comparing the two I do think the one I'm currently working on is like, the not the best, but just like for me, because I do hear their stories. And I'm like, I don't know what I would do in those situations. Yeah.

Simon Cullen
No, I mean, it certainly sounds like your clinic has got some problems with their management. But wow, I've heard I've heard terrible stories. I'm curious, what you're basing my judgment on? What sort of stories are you getting from other RBTs.

Unknown Speaker
Um, so from what my RBC friends have told me is that a lot of it has to do with like their clients or not having sufficient training or like, feeling very much on your own in last in the process when having a supervisor could benefit both ends. Because for me, at least, I get, I always say pretty consistent supervision hours, which helps me my RBT credentials as well. But like my other two friends, they're just like, we don't know what's going on. I don't know. Like, for example, one of my friends is dealing with an aggressive client, which has recently escalated as well. But when she reported to her supervisors asked me for advice or help or like, what can I do to de escalated, her supervisors didn't really take the risk seriously, it was just like, Oh, it's just a phase. It's just a phase, until one of them finally came out. And they're like, I didn't know is that that she's like, I've been trying to tell you, you know, not taking seriously, I have another friend for a different company. She had a knife pulled out on her from one of her kids, one of her kids ran to the kitchen, grab a knife. Yeah. And like, she was very quick though. She like you know, grabbed it, but now she's trying to like fight the kid, like, you know, not like brushing him but just like, hey, like, you can't do that. And her supervision was, unfortunately, on telehealth, which is no one's fault. It's the most convenient that you can do while also providing the most amount of hours. But her supervisor isn't really providing much instead of just saying like, Oh, like, you know, we don't do that or like, like, what we have to use our words. But obviously my French is like, why am I here? This kid has a knife is trying to grab a knife. Like you're not really helping Versa Mom, get the mom. So that's what I'm saying. Like, I at least I have support. They're not seeing that, like my apparent still because I don't know the situation in your companies. But if our initiatives I just I would probably cry on the spot.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, no, I've heard stories of RBTs who were completely unprepared and unsupported being attacked by multiple kids, who, you know, the kids are themselves kind of like their victims in the situation because they're in this incredibly chaotic environment. And, you know, they're reacting to all sorts of things planned ignoring very, very long dTT sort of things that seem like they really get amplified, that behaviors get amplified and then yeah, it can be a very dangerous mix for sure. I've heard I've heard some Are stories. So? Okay, so I'm going to mark that as, yeah, you do feel respected in your clinic at the moment. But obviously, the transcript is going to be important. Alright, so I want to talk a little bit about your training and preparation. So considering both the training and education provided by the BAC B, and by your first supervisor, do you think that your training prepares you? Well, for your first day working with clients?

Unknown Speaker
I honestly Yes. Then more on the way the contribution goes to my supervisor, because she was there for me consistently, like every single session for the first three months for me, the trainee from the like these bseb. Sorry. But like the training, at least online is just online, you don't really know what to do. And prior to this, I didn't like working with kids. I didn't have any experience raising kids. So I was very much just kind of like, like, you are like, Why am I here? So my super like, but over the year and a half I worked here I'm like, my perspective has definitely changed. Like I love working with kids. And like, Yes, I still get like the I need to wash my hands like breakfast instant. But, you know, my supervisors have definitely helped me to like, alleviate that kind of stressed I used to honestly put on myself, because of like, I will see like my narrowmindedness at the time.

Simon Cullen
I mean, it sounds like he really You lucked out in terms of your supervision for sure. Currently, it is do you believe that most RBTs have enough training to work with clients who might be nonverbal, noncompliant injuring themselves aggressive?

Unknown Speaker
It's hard for me to tell just because I don't really witness that. I would probably say no base of what I hear and hearing other people, for lack of a better word complain about inexperience, workers who definitely show that the lack of care and empathy they provide in their service. Because I think there was one time I was working on a school case. And typically, I love the school. So the arrangement I like, like bags, and I asked, I was like, I love the school so much like can you make me like the prime sub if you ever need it, but one time, I couldn't make it because of you know, prior commitments. So they had another guy come in. And literally the next time he came in, everyone was like, don't like, come here every single day that last guy was so like, you smell like cigarettes, he didn't care about being there. Like he annoyed everyone the yard stuff, the actual teachers, the kids, like it was so like, I heard the most complaints I've ever heard. And apparently, he's been with us for a while too. He's not just brand new. So like, I think it just has to like, the amount no matter how much supervision or like experience you have. I think it also narrows down to like how much you actually care to be here. I think the mistake of having this decision labeled as an entry level job is so you know, Mr. Like, it's misleading. Because it doesn't really emphasize the amount of responsibilities needed to carry this job. Like, yes, you are required. If you are RBT to like, get the exam done. Yes, you're required to take training, but the same time is like those training modules are pretty easy to like you just pass it through. So I think it's, it's a complexity of things. But yeah, go ahead.

Simon Cullen
We're still talking?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, no, no, it's just kind of like, Yeah, I think there are definitely a lot of people out there who take this job, too easy. So

Simon Cullen
imagine that you are the new like, well, dictator of ABA, and you can change the training, you can change the systems. What would you do to try and solve the problems that you've pointed to with RBTs? I mean, what sort of warnings would you put on the Java sort of people would you look for what sort of red flags would you be concerned about?

Kyle
Oh, goodness. I think one thing I haven't mentioned,

Unknown Speaker
it's just like, there's a lot outside the job description that you kind of have to do. And you're not going to be happy about that. Like, for example, changing diapers. That's not part of the job description, but I had to do it and I never did it before. And I was just like, well, this sucks, like, not only for me, but the kid because like, I don't know, like they could get an infection or something. I don't know how to do this. So I really had to turn when my coworkers been like, helped me. I don't know what to do. And that's another thing too, I think part of the sexism that comes in this field, because like many people are just like you don't know I change the diaper or like, even going down to like my pay raise, like the people that were paid labor dollars an hour are much more than me, they're all guys, like the supervisor that's paid more than my supervisor is that guy. So even if that might not be the explicit case, but like that's, that's a message I'm hearing also, there's so much. I think, if everyone started off with like, the amount of supervision I had, like I very much luckily had those first like three months with my like, first ever kid, I think that definitely helps with the transition of things, you're still gonna get frustrated, because it's mostly like, a personality thing to with yourself. And with your client. Understanding, you have to adapt. Because the four I used to be like, very strict and very like Tiger Mom, boys, like telling the kids to stop doing whatever it is that they're doing that is like, Dean, correct. But over time, as I work with more kids and understand how they work, and also reflecting back on myself, like, this is not how I want to be treated, if I were this kid. And quite honestly, like very small tech side tangent, but like, this is why I want to do this interview, because I was in a course back when I was still in college of you know, how is it like working in like fields that aren't appreciated. And a project I had to do was on a BA those my very my interest at the time. And to my very much surprise and disappointment there is such little research based on the employee's point of view is always about the clients and like the trauma that they endured not to, you know, dismiss it. But it was just like, I'm doing this project based on like my own perspective, and I can't find anything to support it. So I think that's just very telling of itself, the lack of care that the boys have. And that affects the clients too, because of like, this weird power dynamic, because honestly, all the power goes to the kids, all the clients, their families, and you just have to provide the services no matter what. I'm so sorry. I was just,

Simon Cullen
oh, I'm actually quite interested to hear your reflections on that. And generally don't hold back from sharing. I mean, so I'll just say, what you notice is exactly what I noticed. When I first learned about ABA therapy. I you know, first of all, just after overcoming the surprisingly, this existence of this pie thing I didn't know anything about even though I work in psychology, cognitive science, all this stuff. But then I very quickly found, first of all BAC bees were the first people that I started talking to. And I very quickly had the sense that I was not getting the full story. Often they owned the clinics, or they were like unusually awesome or whatever. And so I went looking for research, like, first of all, I learned the BAC V only requires like RBTs are supervised at least 5% of the time. So here we have a population of people, who are the people that are primarily responsible for delivering this therapy with a highly vulnerable and challenging population. And I just saw, like, wow, red flags going off everywhere. And yet I couldn't find anything about the AVI tapes, I couldn't find a single survey of athletes. All I knew was that I was hearing these stories about wild amounts of turnover. Companies that just never stopped hiring because people never stopped quitting. And I thought, Okay, well. Luckily, I'm a professor, I have students who will work for me as research assistants, why don't we put together a team and spend the summer finding out what we can? And boy, have we found out a lot. So I don't I want to encourage you to share your thoughts on these matters. That's why I'm talking to you. I think it's important that these perspectives are knowing and I'm devoted to not just publishing, you know, an academic piece or something where there are lots of academic pieces that are, you know, critiques of this or that, that seemed to have actually no effect. I believe that the RBTs we have a fairly urgent problem. And I think it should be a national conversation. I think if parents knew what was happening, they could put pressure on the clinics. You know, the parents knew how much the people who actually work with their children paid the conditions like if they knew how many of the people that actually work with their parents, don't get bathroom breaks. Don't get paid when people cancel. Don't know how they're going to pay their rent next month. I've heard so many RBTs other than either of us, actually, who are like one told me the other day her kid was like, Mommy, why aren't you paying the rent? I think if the parents knew about this, they would put pressure on the clinic, and that we can have a pretty big effect on this and I'm really devoted to doing that. So pleased to share your views on this matter, I think it's important. You're one of a relatively small number of people who who have come forward and who are talking about these issues. And it's extremely important. And that's why I'm so grateful that you and people like you have been calling us. Okay, so I want to get back to some stuff on training. But again, don't feel bad. You're not derailing anything, I don't particularly care if we get through all the questions on my script. I'm just most interested to learn as much as I can from you and sort of your unique perspective on this. So I'll continue but don't worry about going off in a sidetrack. Okay. So, did the training and education provided by the BAC B ever discuss the potential for harm or abuse in ABA therapy, and I want that to be understood as both harm or abuse of the RBTs. And also of the clients.

Unknown Speaker
Very briefly, in the training modules, there's like one section, like out of the, let's say, 16, or 20 of them, one section is just like how to defend yourself. And it's not really defending yourself, it's just kind of like, the stance where you like, push and move away, like, nothing much to dive into there.

Simon Cullen
So it was like a redirection type of

Unknown Speaker
kinda or like, what happens if a kid like it, for example, that like you, like, it's just very, like, briefly, like, you could very easily forget about that module.

Kyle
Um, okay. So I,

Simon Cullen
I'm guessing you probably think that's a problem. Do you think the BAC we should be educating therapists about the potential for harm? And let's talk both about the threats to the RBTs? And also, other clients?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, yes, for sure. Again, like going also, I never only went on for 45 minutes, but I'm honestly free until we can go a little over that for sure. Yeah, I've got it fine. Staying at one o'clock, because I do enjoy.

Unknown Speaker
But um,

Unknown Speaker
because again, like doing the research, or like finding, there's no research base on like, RBTs. But there's so much features and clients, it made me reflect a lot of my actions at the time being like, Oh, my God, like, there's a few things that I could abuse in my case, at least verbally, or like, my, that's the slight tone, a change I have, could be enough to impact negatively, because that's how it was me personally growing up. So I was like, doing low self reflecting. And even though I didn't get the answers that I wanted, it made me honestly, like, it made me change for the better, and understand my clients because it just made me more empathetic. Because I was too self involved with myself and being bitter about like my pay rate, or like, whatever it is that's going on in my life. And I forgot to like consider like, these are just children. And so there's definitely, there could definitely be abuse. For kids in this field, there could definitely be abuse from Maya as an RVT. Because I'm not gonna lie. The first month, I was working with my very first kid, he threw a table at me. He threw, and I was just like, No, we're not doing that clean up right now. And he's laughing, you know, it's just a behavior. But like me, I was just like, it's not funny. So I think, again, with the whole calling, being an RVT, as an entry level job is so misleading. And I think it's also a way for like personal hire LCV not taking our safety, or CPS as like liabilities as seriously as they could, when so much can like, we're like, what the five people on top and you have like 100 people taking care of your services out there hiding and make sure that we're all taking care of with like, the utmost care and quality there. There's no, there's no such thing. Like, that's why everything comes off the telehealth now, which yes, it does provide more supervision hours, but it doesn't really do as much good to like, services out there. And I expressed my complaints already to my company. And they told me to where they're like supervisors are only, like so much of us. And I understand I would never, ever put that blame on them. But it's a feedback that I do have to provide.

Simon Cullen
So you you took your concerns about the fact that the supervision was occurring through some kind of remote, whatever, some app, I guess you went and said you felt like that was really insufficient. I've heard that from so many RBTs. I've heard IBT is telling me they've never been in the same room as a supervisor or bseb. i So So you brought your concerns to management, and what was their response? Um,

Unknown Speaker
well, for me, the reason why I was able to express this was because I was also put on our company's culture team, which is just planning events outside to hopefully help the retention rate get lower with not really any extra amount of pay. I only get like an extra $8.50 per month if I attend these meetings, so yeah, like it's kind of a joke to be in this culture meeting but anything to help them my resume. But, so that's why I had that opportunity to express all the concerns that I've been hearing the frustrations that I've been personally dealing. And it's the same thing over and over again was just like, yeah, like, we're not really the ones in charge of that. But like, I understand where you're coming from. And a lot of people were when I told, you know, my friends and supervisors in the company, they were very surprised to hear that I ran up there, like you said, like, and I was just like, Yeah, cuz, like, he mainly that's not right. You

Simon Cullen
surprised? So I just want to know, why do you think they were so surprised that you mentioned that to

Kyle
management? So one huge I think, thing

Unknown Speaker
that separates me from a lot of people from the company or like he's me standing out, is because of what a lot of people probably see my lack of professionalism in this field. I'm not afraid to just be myself and say things as they are, I still say it with sensitivity, and like, you know, with understanding consideration from the others person, other people that are there, but because I don't know, I think, again, when I told you like, I asked my co workers how much they're making, they had to like, put me in another room and close the door. Because professionally, that's not allowed me to get in trouble with the company, if the supervisors hear about it. And like, even then I was just like, that's not right. Like, I have to know if I'm being fairly compensated. So where I like it professionalism, I make up for it with my ability to connect with people. And with my ability to speak on whatever it is right or wrong. The worst that can happen is that will already have probably been fired. But the worst that can happen at the time, it's just they just tell me that statement again, like, oh, we hear you, but no, can do. Yeah, but doesn't mean I'm not going to keep saying it.

Simon Cullen
Right. I mean, the consequences of speaking it up are manageable. It sounds like, I don't want to put words in your mouth at all. But it seems like what you I mean, I can imagine someone listening into this conversation, thinking that what you're describing is something like a culture of fear, where

Unknown Speaker
people are afraid.

Unknown Speaker
And that's something I think I've noticed from a lot of the companies, I think just the culture in let's just say America, in general, like professionally, you can't really speak about this sort of stuff. But I find that like, where I lag in the professionalism, that's what helped me to keep my clients all this time is why they all asked me every single time there's a stuff available. Like, again, I'm not like tooting my horn, but I understand my worth here. And I understand that it ties in again, my ability to make connections with people. That's why I've

Unknown Speaker
I

Unknown Speaker
keep offering positions in this company, but also turning down because I know like, I'm not gonna be fairly compensated for it.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, yeah. Yeah,

Simon Cullen
you're in a difficult position, for sure. I mean, so what you're describing are certainly circumstances where I could easily see I mean, you've already mentioned having a table thrown at you, someone who another RBT, who had to disarm a client with a knife. I am curious if you have seen these problems due to lack of preparation, lack of supervision, lack of training, percolate all the all the way to really dangerous situations there? Is that something that you've witnessed?

Unknown Speaker
Personally, I have not witnessed like the my thing. And again, when the tables thrown at me, that was when I was first learning about my client. That's the first time I was ever put in the field on my own no supervision.

Simon Cullen
Are you given note about that clients aggression? Or no, because this was

Unknown Speaker
a brand new client with the company as well. So every brand new with all of us, when I talked to them about it, she was like, this never happened. Like yes, he has like data, throwing things, but never like table at me. So it's so hard to answer this question because there's so much that can be involved in it. Like, sometimes kids just take you by surprise of things, whether it no matter how guarded or how well prepared you are, anything can happen. And you have to be so quick on your feet about it. And even then, you have to consider everything that's in motion and like what is the most like, right outcome for those who are guaranteed the most amount of safety? There's so many things because I think after like, oh gosh, like for one example, I call COVID for my kid, and this was when mass were still a thing. And honestly, this is when like the mass media was slowly beating up and not quite yet. And my kid he is verbal,

Kyle
but to get

Unknown Speaker
the better like Russell odds are higher like, you know, trial numbers. I noticed it works best when he sees you talk when like you had to point out to him. So right when I did that he caught his knees in my mouth. I forgot which one. And then next week I was out. And then I got I called coworkers. He gave it to him. No, it was the other way around. So like, see, like, stuff like that, where I was trained and like, advised to do that or like, witnessing, like, what works well with other supervisors, or understanding my client and like trying to adapt to like whatever's happening in a situation. sanitizes. So bites you in the butt?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, absolutely. All right. So

Simon Cullen
we've talked a bit about your supervision. So I'm going to skip over the questions. One question I guess I have there is, if your BCBA ever asks for your feedback, when creating a treatment plan, given that the other person spending all this time with the client?

Unknown Speaker
Like To clarify, but what I would say or

Simon Cullen
Yeah, so like, you know, how collaborative is your work with the basic,

Unknown Speaker
very collaborative here, at least in my case, I think because I've built such a strong rapport with all of my clients, and with my supervisors. Again, there are even times where, you know, for example, if you go into someone's house, you see, maybe it might be a parenting thing. But that's not your position to see it. But I feel such a strong relationship over time where they trust me, the parents, where I can tell them, sometimes I'm just like, I think it's contributing to you. I think, like, this is like an attention seeking behavior. And like, I need you to leave the room. Because there are many times, for example, one client, he would always have like, tantrums, but not because anything was happening, but because he was just trying to escape from having to do work. And so he was crying. And I noticed mama come into, like, save him, essentially. And finally, I really put myself in the middle. And I was just like, No, she's like, Oh, what, and I was like, I'm sorry, but like, you are part of the problem for this case, like, he's crying because he wants to leave. And I need to understand he can't cry himself out of it anymore. Like stuff like that. So I think because, again, maybe my what people will call my lack of professionalism. Because I have been told by that by my supervisor and Loki, I'm a little bitter about it. But I'm like, because of my ability to connect with people in like, the way that I do. It also makes me I think, credible, to have a say in their data book. And I have to like my supervisors, because sometimes the parents, I won't lie, I think sometimes they undermine a situation or they don't take it as seriously as they could or contributed back to themselves. Because sometimes it is a parenting issue to where they enable the behaviors. And so I tell them, I suppose you'd be like, hey, like, I'm like this happens, because like, the parent does this sometimes. Or like, the parent will admit to like, let's say, for example, keep track of the amount of tantrums but I think that's something we need to do in the near future, once the right to have a conversation. And my supervisors are always taking in my words, they're always like considering what I have to say, and treat me with the utmost respect. And how told me many times like I'm very reliable when it comes to this field. And again, like what you said, like they're surprised that I am choosing the decision to not become a supervisor here.

Simon Cullen
Sure. All right, well, let's move on to some of the behaviors that you might work on. So if any of the clinics are in the school that you've worked, have they helped clients to manage this stimming behaviors, for example, by teaching them to control stimming in situations where it might be distracting?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, it's more for home settings, and it's for school settings. I think it just has to do with the type of clients I had at school, they don't really struggle with that. If they did, I would just easily redirect them with the like stimming like toy or the fidget, whatever they have, like that is provided from the school or allowed by the school. Because at least in the home setting, we do work on those a lot. Or, again, it's just trying to understand the client and their needs. Like why is it understanding because I have one kid in particular, like, Houston's because he needs to pressure. So I'm like, Do you need a hug or excuses? And he's like, yes. And I'm like, okay, like, come here, because they always forget to like, ask for it. They just act out impulse. It's not necessarily their fault. It's just how it is. And I think my supervisors are very understanding of that and trying to understand from the kids perspective, but it's just so hard like you just have to it's a new thing every single day.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, for sure. So what's the goal, generally, when you are working on steering?

Unknown Speaker
I think for most of my clients, it's just working out communication at the very least. Each data book is always personalized, and it has to do with like the parents. personal goals, too. Rather than, like, what could be deemed as, like, socially acceptable, but for example, like parents, they just want the kids to talk to them. So my kid thinks it would be like stimming, like five minute scans, and then we'll be like, oh, like, Do you need a hug and he's like, hug. And I'm like, Okay, so at the very least, is always narrows down to communication, or at least, you know, functional communication.

Simon Cullen
So just to make sure I've got that clear. So when you're working with stimming, in one way or another, the aim is, in as much as you're trying to change the stimming behavior, you're doing it to try and improve the way the client communicates. Or if they are trying to communicate something using their stimming, you've identified that function, and now you want to teach them a different way to communicate that,

Unknown Speaker
yes, because you can't really change stimming behaviors is them saying we have a need, that is outside their control. And a lot of people don't really understand that a lot of times, they're just like, just stop doing it. I myself was one of those people included, when I first started working, I was like, it's in on your hands, like, it's okay. But obviously, they're not gonna be happy about that that's not meet their needs. So like, sorry, because like when it comes to communication, the client also identifies for themselves what their needs are. And at the end of the day, like, if you can make do with what's going on in your life, like, if your parents are okay with it, then that's fine. But you just have to learn how to tell us, that's all we ask.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. I'm curious. A little, you know, so you mentioned when you were starting out, and you were like, You didn't yet understand what the stimming was for. And so, understandably, your reaction was, you know, let's just try and cut this out. You may have since come across, you know, autistic people often saying that stimming plays actually an important role and helping them to sometimes it's to stay calm, or to kind of deal with sensory information, or even to focus and things like that. So you can sort of imagine now, why autistic people sometimes now claim that ABA is focused on stimming can be harmful. I'm curious what your reaction to that is. Now,

Unknown Speaker
to be honest, this is kind of the first I've heard of that argument. Pretty, like, ignorant on the topic, I do apologize for that. Like, I can definitely understand the perspective like, sometimes like when my kids don't, that's when I had to learn, like eventually on my own. That was never explicitly said to me about my kids. I was just like, from their accent, I'm like, I just let them have a few seconds to minister process, what I've said, and then once because like, they're just like, what autism was described to me was just like, kids are just in their own reality, like their own separate reality, and what actually goes on in the world. And you can't fault them for being in a different, like status or flow of time. Like, they're just living their life as they think it is. And so for me, once understanding that I'm just kind of it works to like, with my one kid who I deemed to be my most challenging, like, he just needs a couple of minutes or seconds to like, process what I said, do his thing. And usually who respond. I am pretty good at telling when he gets too much into this to me. So I have to like redirect like, Hey, buddy, like, Come like, Did you hear what I said? And he's like, No, and I'm like, Okay, I was like, Can you do this? For me? He's like, Yeah. So a lot of it just has to do with processing time. And like, I'm more than happy to adapt and accommodate to like, Whatever needs my clients are, I think it just has to, again, narrow down the understanding of like, what goes on outside of ourselves, or what is to be expected from like the social norm.

Simon Cullen
I want to go back to one thing you said in there. So when it was sort of autism was kind of first explained to you, it was explained as like these kids are kind of, you know, in their own worlds. Where do you think that vision of autism comes from? Certainly nothing I've I've ever heard from, you know, reading work on, you know, medical, medical work on autism or anything like that. Where do you think that sort of idea comes from?

Unknown Speaker
I think, well, I had this conversation with my my RBT friends, and like, that's one of their supervisor explained to them. Because, for example, when kids are stimming, it's just like, there's so in the moment of it. And like, maybe it's not necessarily a different world or reality. But it's like when you're so into something like we we all do this, like we're in the flow when it comes to completing a task. We don't want to be disturbed. We don't want to do anything like to break that up. So we want to complete wherever it is until we feel satisfied. And I believe the same could be said for kids with autism or people who believe that like stimming is what helps them to process whatever goes on in their lives. Just the best way how I can imagine it, and I don't know, it just made the most sense when I heard it.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, I mean, certainly one of the things that I was really surprised when I kind of started learning about ABA was Well, ABA is based on a science, which isn't really concerned with autism. It's concerned with behavior, right? If you go read the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, it's like article after article after article about how to shape and mold behavior, I think, you know, essentially tied to autism or a deep understanding of autism. So I'm always curious, like, where the sort of field comes up with its own ideas about autism. So it's really, this is a very interesting point for me. What about eye contact? Have you ever helped clients work on eye contact?

Unknown Speaker
I used to before, but quite honestly, it's pretty hypocritical of me, because I hate eye contact myself. And to be honest, as long as a kid just hears what goes on in response to it, that's all I care about. Because again, like, for me personally, like eye contact is really hard. I don't even like it myself, and I'm not diagnosed with anything that I'm aware of. So just because we do one thing a certain way, depending on like, the social norms of it, I don't think it should really be enforced because the outcome is still the same. We just do things differently.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, yeah.

Simon Cullen
It's kind of interesting, when autistic people sometimes talk about like that it can be physically painful, or, in any case, deeply distressing to make themselves make eye contact, and you kind of hear them tell the stories and just like, I don't know, I get that you want to, you know, orient yourself towards the person talking to you. So they know that you're there and aware, but like, do you really have to look into my eyes to achieve that? And you're kind of like, well, I guess night, you can look at my ear or anyhow, just face me. Yeah, I'm, it's interesting. So I wonder, you know, some of the questions, this, some of the things that these questions are trying to get at is like, to what extent, and you mentioned this, like, often the parents goals are kind of informing what you're trading? The, I guess the deeper question is, to what extent is this therapy being used to kind of shape the behavior of autistic kids to appear more neurotypical? Maybe that's by you know, not doing with hand flapping? Or not, you know, you know, being unable to stare into people's eyes? To what extent do you feel like, I mean, just to put it really bluntly, to you, do you feel that therapy is used to just try and make these kids appear normal, in a way, which isn't essentially tied to their well being, but maybe just tied to their parents being worried about having a weird kid or something.

Unknown Speaker
That is definitely one of my biggest concerns here. And, again, I'm very fortunate to not really have dealt by my situation. And if I did, I would just talk to the parents, because again, like, I have very strong relations with them. So I will just tell them, like, ask me, like, hey, you know, like, I used to do this, and like, I did that, like, and you guys like me. And I think a lot of it. change has occurred a lot over time with us, for the school pieces of it, I one of them is very inclusive, where it's like a mixture of like neurotypical and neurodivergent kids in the same classroom. And to be honest, maybe because I've been surrounded in this sort of environment for over, you know, a year and a half now. Like, is like my norm. Like, I, when I see kids acting in whatever behaviors they do, for me, I'm just like, okay, like, they're just doing their own thing, the only thing I'm most concerned about, if they're being too aggressive, or like creating harm upon themselves, or other people, that's when I'm like, Tiger mongoid, like, stop that, like, get down, like you're being disruptive. But I definitely feel like a lot of it does have to do from the parents side. And they're associated, like, feelings of like shame, because I'm not gonna lie, like, a lot of people are just not out there. And I don't blame them for feeling this way. Also, like when you have a kid, everyone expects to have like, a perfect family. Like, I think a lot of times parents are still coping with the fact that they have a neurodivergent child, and they have to learn new ways of communicating that was never introduced to them is so much to unpack. And if I feel that way, already, just by being a part time worker for a company that pays me even though unfairly, but still pays me, I can't imagine how that feels for a parent who net like, totally didn't sign up for this doesn't get paid no time off, like, this is their life forever.

Kyle
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Simon Cullen
No, I don't mean to show a lack of empathy for the parents or anything like that. I think you're right to the point, like how complicated these situations are, and how easy it is to misunderstand them. So you mentioned you know, one point where you'll Yeah, the tiger mom comes out. That's self injurious behaviors. So I assume you you've worked with kids who had themselves

Unknown Speaker
one kid that I worked with. So our company we have like Windows but they're not just typical windows. They're the ones going from like, you know, from the ceiling to the floor, he's only like, he's very little. It's only like five or six. He's very aggressive. He's kicking the window, you broke that window. And he's banned from the clinic. Wow. Yeah. So and here's the thing, my partner at the time, because at the clinic, we work in like group, like, you're kind of partner up. So the kids can have some peers, associating my partner, he's a good, he's good at his job. But I think he's too lacks. And I'm too like, you know, I have to talk about, so oftentimes I find myself having to like, unfortunately, yell at his kid. Because, again, with the unfortunate side of things, I think, this child only responds to an authoritative tone. Because when you do a q&a with him, he just keeps, like ignoring you, or like continued on with the behavior. But when I just say, like, get off the table, or like, like, sit down, and he's like, but he's gonna say. So like, again, like, behavior is so strange, but like, that's where I notice some things, but some clients like?

Simon Cullen
Sure, so considering, you know, all of the settings you've worked in, what percentage of clients would you say have a problem with hurting themselves?

Unknown Speaker
Maybe,

Unknown Speaker
maybe the home setting because I told this appearance, too, because a lot of nurse do I have like parents or who have like, or teenager clients with their parents. And you know, teenagers are very, like, mean, already, the whole, you know, stereotypical, like hormonal teen behavior. nxm is, so some parents are just like having a hard time, in addition to that being are divergent. And I tell them, I was like, kids act like the worst version of themselves, because they feel the most safe at home. I have another client, he's only like, you know, under six years old, or maybe he's six now. But like, he kept having like, a lot of issues where he ran away from home, not for any party, but he wasn't hateful. He's just like, I want to see what car drove by. And he'll run to that car into like, the corner, and then the parents find out because they have upstairs. So the parents find out, they're like, Oh, my God, where did my kid go? And like, this was an issue for a while. So like, I definitely think home settings are where they can occur the most, because that's where they have the most access to things and understanding, and also where they can feel like the most of themselves, you know?

Kyle
Because I don't know, like, maybe because

Unknown Speaker
I'm at home settings most of the time as well. So maybe I have a skewed perspective there. But that's what I would say,

Simon Cullen
in the home setting, what percentage of clients would you say are engaging in self injurious behaviors or dangerous behaviors?

Unknown Speaker
I have, like, let's say the 13 clients I've had, and maybe two of them were had like data or behavior plans when it comes to self interest behavior. Okay, so like,

Simon Cullen
maybe 15% around there.

Unknown Speaker
All right.

Simon Cullen
We've talked a bit about the challenges from that. I mean, I have a question on here, which is, do you feel your training prepared you to work from the work with these clients from the beginning? I know you've already talked about that. But was there anything you wanted to add to what you've already said?

Unknown Speaker
I feel like it's just always, like, no matter how prepared you are, or how you feel, I feel like it just goes with any job, like you just don't know until you're fully in it. And then time passes by with practice understanding the situation, like, anything can happen even to this day, after working, like, however long I did. There's still surprises coming at me. Like the other day, my kid he wanted to hook and he jumped on top of me, I was like, Oh, my God, and I busted my shoulder. And I'm just like, like, you know, no harm done. So I didn't yell at him or anything. I was just like, oh, like, you gotta tell me when you want to hug. Or like, like, there's so many funny stories I have to my kids that make me like, find them so endearing and so lovable because sometimes what they want is just my attention, but they don't know how to tell me. So sometimes they'll throw stuff at me because they're like, Hey, I'm talking to you. And I'm like, we don't throw. And then I come here, and they're like, no, no, no, no. Because if they can get like, I'm mad. I don't like I'm not mad. But you need to pick up what you do. Because that's not nice. Like stuff like that redirecting understanding what tone works best with each kid. There's so much that you just have to learn on your own. It doesn't matter what protocol is there, like? Yes, it's good to have an overall guidance of things. But no matter what you do, you're nothing like really prepare for what's out there in the world.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Sorry. Please continue.

Unknown Speaker
It's just what you can like say for parenting too. I would, I would assume.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, me too. I don't have kids, but it sounds plausible. You have time to do a quick lightning round. I've got a list of behaviors, which are commonly parts of clients treatment plans. And I'm curious if you've ever had a treatment plan that involves any of these behaviors, so you can just give me a yes or no.

Unknown Speaker
Reading. Over Yeah.

Kyle
safety behaviors. Yes. autonomy and independence. Yes. Asking for their own needs. Yes. following commands. Yep. Sitting in with their peers. sitting still no. Increasing communication. Yes. Are they training? Yes. Social interaction. Yep. Behaviors that could hurt others. Oh, yes. Yeah. Because it could hurt the client. Yes. Attracting behaviors or distracting behaviors? Yeah. State behaviors? Yes. elopement. Yes. Screaming? Yeah. Oscar refusal? Yes. Anything you want to add to the list that I didn't ask? Oh, that's a long, long list. Yeah. Ah.

Unknown Speaker
No, I think we got them all. That was a lot to do. So.

Simon Cullen
Okay, I'm gonna just sort of skim through here and see, I got like a couple if you've got another sort of five to 10 minutes, I've got a couple more quests I'd love to get from you. Great. All right. So one thing we've learned from talking to RBTs is that in some situations, that RBT should actually just ignore certain maladaptive behaviors. Do you ever use planned ignoring? I do. Okay, and what specifically do you use it for?

Kyle
I have

Unknown Speaker
this one. Client, it's not mine. But there are siblings. So I work with one. And then my other partner works with another. The other client, their brother, and sister, let's just say that so the sister, she's the one with the maladaptive attention seeking behavior, where she with herself on the ground on purpose, she would if we say, oh, we need a break, she would cry and be like, don't leave me or like, or, again, just do anything for attention, anything. And so because I don't work with a sister, I have more leniency to ignore. And because I worked with kids a lot longer than my coworker has, I've learned that like, sometimes I'm just not going to pay them attention. Because I have other kids who do exact same thing to where they throw things at me. And they want to laugh at it. Because even if I didn't like a glare, or I'm like getting reaction, they're like, they love it. Because kids love to push button sometimes. But so over time, I've learned to just be very stoic to, like, I don't give attention unless it's like, you know, deemed appropriate. So for her every time she has this sort of like, extreme reaction to whatever goes on just for seeking behavior. I just have to ignore her sometimes. And I feel terrible for it. But like, sometimes I don't say hi to her, because then she would just cling on to me. And even the mom and my coworker notices because now every time my coworker comes into the house, she is like, she's fine the whole day until my call comes in. And she's like, and can't blame the little one for that. Like, she's just so excited. That's how much emotions are to her. But, again, we can't encourage this sort of behavior, especially now. She's like, throwing herself on the floor for refusing to be cooperative, especially if it seems like her own safety.

Simon Cullen
So do the kids ever feel same, like frustrated when they're ignored? Did they have did the tantrums, you know, explode? What sort of reactions do you

Unknown Speaker
observe? Oh, yeah, I think it's for her in this particular case, I think it depends on the person because she understands or like she, yeah, she understands the expectation of which like, she would not get a reaction out of me. So now she's just like, tiny initially walked away. But if it's a coworker, if she were to ignore her, or even to say, like, hey, like, Stop, she would cry and cry and cry. And I have other clients to where again, they try, like, throw stuff at me. And I'm like, even though the reaction, and then they'll just be like, Okay, I'm just gonna stop then and just go on. Like, again, I'm trying to be very sensitive and consider it for my client's needs. But I think it's gotten to the point where I can tell her something is just like, attention seeking behavior. And I'm just like, hey, like, again, like, do you want to tell me something? And then I was like, hey, like, What's my name? Brittany. And I'm like, okay, like, hi, like, What can I help you with? And then they're like, Yay, and I'm like, Yeah, talk to me. Okay, going hurt. I got a boo boo. And then they're like, you know, so it definitely depends on the kid. In because I'm not going to like our sister is very tricky to work with, like, I think everything is an attention seeking behavior from her particular.

Simon Cullen
So do you use the dTT approach or the ABC method?

Unknown Speaker
I have a few times I'm with the first kid I worked with. He's very, not very severe, but he is on the more severe end of that. And, for example, we're trying to teach him this is like the worst time of my life. We're trying to teach him prepositions, which is up under in is the most boring thing ever teach a child? It is so bad. So but like, we have to use that technique for the kids to understand and he was getting for a while. But it also has to do with the child's sense of motivation. Because sometimes, kids can default they can just scroll through whatever like, oh, like you say in he puts it on. And he's like, No, that's not it. So he just puts it in. But they don't really want to lie. They're just like, if I do this, then I get out of here, anything, because I'll get it eventually. So it's such a difficult technique to use, especially on kids who are so prompt dependent. It is so hard, because sometimes you feel the frustration yourself, but you can't take it on a kid. So you're just like, and like it would be like, angry. And I'm like, That's right. Like, yeah. Like, me, and I like Yeah. So like, it's yes, I do use a technique, but I hate it.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, so when you're using it, how long will you usually get the kid to work before giving them a rest?

Unknown Speaker
So we have a token boards or token economies that can help us out I do. At the very most, I think five for like, because sometimes you use like the technique, and then you switch it up with a different like activity to like, spice it up a little bit. And then but they're still working technically. Um, so I think at the most like, let's say, he has like 10 stickers to earn. I'll do like five of those as like, the techniques I want him to use. But again, it's just so hard like those preposition was I had like, probably four months of that with him, and he still made no progress to this day.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, do you think maybe it's just not a good technique to try and teach prepositions to a child like that?

Unknown Speaker
I think, well, it's hard to answer because here's the thing. He's so prompt dependent. And that probably has to do with like, you know, the home environment because his parents do enable him a lot. Or like, they just like, give him wherever he wants. But then for me, he's like, I have to work with this one. Yes. Like me, but I'm like, I might not like me. But let's work. He's like, so like, that, again? Like it has to do with like, his lack of motivation there him scrolling through, like what's expected? Like, it's not really him learning anything. Like, yes, he acquired the skill, but like he independently do that on his own? No. So it's hard to say like, if this technique is a good one or not, because I have seen him do well with it at a certain point. But again, I think because the databook was there for so long. It's gotten to the point where we just took it out, because we're just like, give up, give up. This is holding him back from graduating, like, get that databook out of here.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, for sure.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so I have a few questions about aversives and punishment. Is that ever used any way you work?

Unknown Speaker
No. Okay.

Simon Cullen
What about restraint? Is that ever used where you work? Okay. I guess I have like a question. I'm, whether or not you how do you so do you work alongside any occupational therapists, speech therapists or anything like

Unknown Speaker
that? Um, no, that's done outside of my work hours.

Simon Cullen
Okay. Do you? Do you think that treatments besides ABA should be considered for autistic kids?

Unknown Speaker
I think?

Unknown Speaker
Well, it's hard for me to say just because I don't really have much knowledge there. But a lot of my clients do have those services outside of our own ABA. I mean, it seems to be working really well with them. And the parents are happy with crystal so I don't see why not to it, like a small kid. Like, again, I think the common goal here, at least for like, my understanding is just effective and functional communication. That's all that matters. However, when you do it, you can do just fine, like AAC device, the pecs or like, verbally or sign language doesn't matter. But as long as like the people in your immediate surroundings, understand your needs. I think that's what's most important. And that seems to be the goal that everyone is achieving right now.

Unknown Speaker
So, yeah,

Simon Cullen
so I guess last couple of questions. What about interacting with parents and caregivers? What's that? Like? What what sort of role do you have there?

Unknown Speaker
I'm very comfortable. I think when I first started working, I was like, you know, very like, like, you know, not uptight, but just kind of like, okay, like, you're a professional, I can't like, accept food when opportunity, I can't take any gifts or anything like that. But over time, like, I also learned that it's hard on the parents perspective, especially seeing like all the single mothers out there, who don't have a social life. And like, their only form of interaction with anyone outside their home is just ABA therapy. And so, before I used to live in Louis asked me, like, what's his name for the weekend, I'm like, Oh, nothing going on, when that was a lie, you know, but now I'm just kind of now you know, I'm sitting on the couch with them or join like, some just water together. Or giggling or like, oh my gosh, like, I tell them, like, for example, my, my boyfriend, and this one client, she was there since the beginning of the story. So she, like, every time I had a date, I always tell her about it. She was like, that sounds so lovely. And like, you know, seeing her like not seeing that aside. So it's just like, you know, it's, you can tell that she is missing the part of the life that she ultimately sacrifice for her two children. Like, and there's so many parents out there, too, like I told you, the one teenage client, like the mom's having a hard time with her because she wants to connect with her. But the teenager being a teenager is just like, eff off mom care. And so she kind of seeks not comfort, but like, you know, some sort of conversations for me. And like, again, my lack of professionalism allows me to, I hope, those words correctly heal this kind of like, void that we all kind of have in our life. Because yes, as I do agree, professionalism is there for a reason. But a lot of people just no matter what your diagnosis or your circumstance, like, we all seek connection. I think that's the most the best form of healing or like improvement that we can all have in like, society. And so I provide, like, you know, it's all my job description, but I provide care for my clients and for the parents, because it's what's needed. Yeah,

Simon Cullen
I bet it means a lot to them. And I agree with you, that sense of connection is so important. And yeah, there's a really, there's a lot of loneliness around and it's hurting a lot of people. I guess my last question, I promise, did you have reflections on I mean, it feel free to say no, if you haven't thought about it. But I mean, you mentioned like single single moms. And a couple of other points in our interview today, you've mentioned things that have sort of made me wonder if you have any thoughts about how maybe ABA, and it's sort of services, and the way they're provided is intersecting with issues around poverty? Or maybe race? If that's relevant at all? Feel free to say no, if you haven't thought about it, but I'm curious if you have any thoughts or reflections?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, definitely. I mean, my major was in counseling and social change. So this is everything I think about on a daily basis.

Unknown Speaker
Teach me about that.

Unknown Speaker
Like intersectionality is such a huge concept is so foreign to everyone here in like America, at least for those who are not willing to understand it, or listen to, like, the conflicts going on in the world, or just even within our own neighborhood. Although I never had to personally endure or witness any, like racism in terms of our clients. But I can only imagine because for example, like there's so many stereotypes out there, for example, like black people being aggressive, and you have a client who has like self injury behavior. What is that going to say? Especially to like, let's say the parents who again, are not prepared to have like a neurodivergent child in their lives are still dealing through the complexity of their own personal life themselves. So much goes into it. Like, again, I've been very fortunate in my time here with this company to, you know, have, I guess, easier clients or, like, families or so understanding of my situation? Because sometimes I tell them, like, I'm not feeling well, to me, or like, my life is in shambles. And they're like, then take the day off, we will pay you under the table, which for this interview, no, I did not take it. Like, you know, like, again, the former connection is just what's most important to us. But there's such a huge, like, narrative of separations that, and I think being part of the neurodiversity community dealing with like, you know, invisible battles is what keeps like, separated from one another to understand. Yes, there's a huge movement of it right now or a huge like effort to spread more awareness and acceptance about it. But you also have like, as much numbers IP as you have for those trying to build like acceptance. There's the same amount of number of people maybe even more, trying to like, keep was in the shadows. It's so hard. Because, again, anything, it just depends on the person and how much they're willing to listen. If not, I can tell like what he's like my major Why'd I graduate this degree because like, so much can be learned and said about one another. It's just our willingness to, like, be part of the conversation. Because again, I think that's what happened, seeing my co workers who came into this job thinking that it's just the money, and then they're like, this job breaking sets, like, I hate kids, they bid me blah, blah, but they don't do the self reflection or like, what did you do? Like, kids don't really, typically don't bite, I don't know, where like, what did you do? And then they're like, Well, I was on my phone. And I'm like, okay, I can see the kid coming, or you didn't redirect behavior. Like, again, people who are paid so much more than me, who don't take the time to learn about what goes on with their kids lives. Like, I think,

Unknown Speaker
part of my develop, like

Unknown Speaker
development, my skills here has to do with talking to the parents to an understanding like their, like cultural history, or like their background. And like, Haley, tell me about your kids and what you did over the weekend. And like the kids or the parents, it's funny, like, Oh, my God, like He talks so much. So functionally, like, it was so cool. And I'm like, awesome, but then I'll see it, I'm like, That's not exactly where I want to be. But like, we can work on that. Let's work river. So I don't know, it's so much can be added to the conversation of everything in our lives. This is just one of the mere subjects that we did touch upon, that can help improve everyone around us, not just for like, you know, capital benefit or like for, you know, avoiding judgment of others. But literally just like, a nice sense of societal and cultural healing.

Kyle
Yeah, well,

Simon Cullen
is there anything we didn't cover that you would like to tell me about?

Kyle
I don't think so.

Unknown Speaker
I think overall, I was just, when I read your guys's email, I was so excited to finally, like, contribute to something with this research that is so desperately needed out there. Because, again, support for what is, you know, fundamentally like the foundation of ABA therapy, in you so much support than what it currently does right now. And again, I think it has to start with the misleading titles of entry level job. It has to do with us having basic understanding for one another. I don't know how we can, you know, narrow down, employees were doing that. But, you know, you can only just hope that so as in this job for the right reasons. Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. Well, like I said, I am, I'm devoted to making all of these people who have talked about us really giving them their voices, the attention that they deserve, and issues that we've been hearing about are important, and they are worth discussing. So I will be doing everything I can. One question. Before I just give you the concluding thing. I wonder if I don't need to suggest that this is certainly what's going to happen. But like I said, I, I think simply publishing this an academic journal would would be inappropriate. I wonder if down the line. Suppose we were to work with, you know, journalists from a respected institution like say, The New York Times or something like that? Would you be comfortable? If I was to suggest you as potentially someone who might want to give an interview, you would work out with them? Any details about anonymity or whatever? I don't know anything about that. But would you be feel absolutely free to say no, but if you'd be comfortable, then I might consider you as someone I could pass along if we do end up talking.

Kyle
Yeah, of course. All right. That's great. All right. So

Simon Cullen
that is the end of the questions that I have prepared. I want to ask if you are comfortable with me sharing the anonymized transcript of today's interview with interested parties like other researchers at my institution or elsewhere, to be very clear, that will not include any details that could be used to identify you. I've had my ears carefully listening for any accidental identifying information. I didn't hear anything but I will check the transcript. So is that okay with you? Yeah, of course. Okay, and what about the recording? Are you happy for me to share that to remember it would not include your name or any other identifying details

Unknown Speaker
so you're good with that I am more than happy to help you contribute to research beautiful

Simon Cullen
Okay, well thank you so much for talking to me thank you for taking the time and and for all of us are shared I am really deeply appreciate it. If you've given me a lot to think about I'll certainly be thinking about it for a while. So if you have any, any questions arise or any concerns arise, just feel free to email me You've got my email address because I emailed you today. Maybe save that and yeah, I, I will put you if you're happy. I'll put you on a list that I'll send out report to later in the fall. You know, When you get that I I'd love to hear your reactions to it so maybe we can talk again then it was it was really a pleasure meeting you thank you

Unknown Speaker
so much for being with us Well Simon thank you so much for this opportunity

Unknown Speaker
absolutely take care bye bye
