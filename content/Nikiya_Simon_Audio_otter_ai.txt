Simon Cullen  
Okay, so just to confirm, you're happy for me to record this interview?

Unknown Speaker  
Yes. 

Simon Cullen  
All right, beautiful.

Thanks very much. So I'm just going to start off with some background questions, and then we'll, we'll get to the deep stuff. So, in what state are you currently working?

Unknown Speaker  
Currently? I'm in Florida. I'm in Jacksonville.

Simon Cullen  
Okay, cool. And what is the highest level of education you've reached so far?

Speaker 2  
So far? I have my high school diploma. I have nine more classes for my bachelor's in social work. So yeah, I'll be getting my bachelor's in maybe a year or so. Not moving on, but maybe moving on?

Simon Cullen  
Well, I'm gonna want to I want to ask a bit about that today. Definitely. But you're nearly there only nine classes. So I know how that feels. So how many years have you been working with clients?

Speaker 2  
Um, I've been working with clients for about a year and a half. I honestly knew nothing about being RBT until 2022. I felt the posting on indeed. And I was just like, okay, so I just went from there. And I pretty much got all of my learning and training last year.

Simon Cullen  
All right. Well, yeah, I'm definitely going to be interested in hearing about your journey into ABA, for sure. So where have you delivered therapy like the home in a clinic and school?

Speaker 2  
Um, I have done in home sessions? Well, I've only had one in home session. I haven't had another home after that. And everything else has been in the center since.

Simon Cullen  
All right. Well, I'm gonna I'm definitely curious about what happened.

Speaker 2  
Um, well, I had a kid who I absolutely loved. He was one of my favorite clients, he was so smart. And like, I genuinely enjoy it, even though like the distance from the center to his home was pretty far. I do enjoy taking that drive, because I knew that I would have like a great time at his house. But he ended up just graduating out of the program. And I was just left without a client. So I, I don't necessarily, I want to say that I didn't want another home. But I'm definitely picking now. So after him, it was just like, I think I'll just stay in a suit.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, all right. Fair enough. I've definitely heard from RBTs about, you know, having to drive around. And sometimes, you know, a client will cancel, and they are out of the money for the gas. And they don't necessarily get to even make up the hours. So definitely sounds difficult. So currently, you hold an RBT credential from the BAC be so cool. So do you have any plans to become a BCBA? yourself?

Speaker 2  
Right now? I'm not gonna say no. Because I've come across some great BCBAs. And you know, it's just like that motivation. I won't say no, but it's not like, it's not in the circulation. So we might agree. I want to do mental health therapy and adoption counseling. So you never know, my mind may just change next year. So maybe, but maybe not.

Simon Cullen  
I'm sorry. I'm just curious. Not really. What's your I've never heard anyone talk about adoption counseling. That sounds super interesting. What What led you to that?

Speaker 2  
So originally, I started with wanting to be a psychology major before I left high school. And I went to Savannah State. That was the first college that I started at. And they didn't have psychology, they only had social work. So once I did the, like, the research, I was like, okay, you know, social work has a lot of opportunities. And my freshman year, I had a class, I don't remember the name, but I remember the professor, her last name was to loach. And we watched this video in the class about a little boy, it was on Netflix. Um, I want to say he's Banik don't quote, I'm pretty sure. But I'm not 100% Sure. But it I came across it. We watched it, we did, you know, writing projects on it. And it kind of touched me in a way because I know, you know, certain kids that I grew up with, they didn't grow up with the best home environment. So it's a little bit of not wanting them in a place that they're not loved, but also placing them in a place where they're gonna be taken care of, because some adoption, you know, families aren't the best either. So that's like my main goal. Like I'm, I'm very big on children starting right.

Simon Cullen  
Amazing. I can't imagine what Incredibly important decision it is for that whole life. So that's really cool and Majan you're gonna make a big difference in lives if you do that. That's wonderful. All right. Well, yeah, thanks for the background questions. I want to, you know, we're very interested in whether RBTs are paid fairly for the work and if, if they're treated well. So do you mind if I ask what your starting salary was in your very first position as an RBT? You don't have to tell me?

Speaker 2  
Oh, I find it very funny because I'm not an I'm honestly like a very direct open person. So I talk about it often. Okay, um, I started off at 16 hours as an RBT. And after I received my, well, technically, I started as a behavior tech before I got my actual credential. And after I got my credentialing, I got a 25 cent raise. So I was at 1216 25. For about, I was at 1625, for about six, seven months, maybe eight. It was pushing the eight month mark. And then I finally said something and I was like, hey, you know, this is this is a little low. Um, and I got bumped up to 18. But because the first company that I started with the hours were really matching, like the Pay It wasn't it the the pay was just too low to be paying bills to have a car note. So I ended up leaving and right now I make 2050. All right. Um, but once again, the hours are not matching. So it's still a little hard, but you know, it's definitely like a big difference.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, for sure. So when you're on 1625? Are you receiving health insurance? No. Okay. And currently, are you receiving health insurance from your work? No. Okay. So how many hours a week would you work in total, considering all of the clients that you're seeing,

Speaker 2  
um, when, with my first company that I started with? I was maybe doing like, for two weeks, probably a total of 40 hours, maybe 45? Sometimes, maybe, like 2025 hours? Then now, um, I would say about 30. It's like barely pushing 30. But it is it hits the 30 marks of tabs.

Simon Cullen  
Okay. All right. And how many, like just considering a single client sort of average client? How many hours per week? Would you work with the average client?

Speaker 2  
who I'm with the first company, I would say, I'm just gonna use one client, for example, because I worked with for maybe a little bit more with the first company. Um, so if I can think back, I would probably say

Simon Cullen  
that 1515 hours. And what about the current company?

Speaker 2  
It's a little bit easier with them, because I'll work with two children now. And we have a schedule. So Monday, Tuesday, I have one Wednesday, Thursday, I have another and then Friday, I go back to the same one that I had on Monday, Tuesday. So with one kid is maybe 15, and the other kid is probably about 10.

Simon Cullen  
Okay. All right. Cool. And so would you be would there be other therapists also working with those kids? Are you? Yeah, so they might be getting like, say, 20 to 30 hours a week, something like that. All right. Yeah. So you mentioned you had a caseload with four clients at the first place. I mean, that's quite a lot. I'm guessing that created some challenges. Do you want to talk at all about that?

Speaker 2  
Um, honestly, it was very draining a lot of times, because even though like I still had a big caseload, it was a lot of cancellations. Children always got sick. So it was it was that and like, having to get up and come to work, and then they end up canceling. So now I've gotten up and went through my day with my first two clients, and I get to my third when he's cancelled, so it does get draining a lot. Indeed. It was very frustrated. I probably cried more times than I could count. But because I appreciate it the kids so much, honestly, the kids made everything better. So I was there for 10 months, and I stayed so long because of them. And I still regret even leaving them today.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, it sounds like you really get your kids. I mean, the first the first one that you had the home time with. Yeah, that's, that sounds like a real challenge. So just a sort of less personal question on I'm thinking about an average clinic, I guess, average, sorry, but been a long day, thinking about an client, maybe get the first clinic and then ask about the second clinic, what would be like the full course of treatment? So when they start at the clinic to when they graduate? Is it you know, in months or years? How long would the average treatment program take?

Speaker 2  
Um, if we're starting, like, from the very beginning, because like, I've started with kids who have started from the very beginning, I was always told, you know, we always were taught in training that three years max, I'm not sure you know, what other RBTs were told, but most children, they do, they are able to meet the standards and meet their mark. And that three year mark, they have been a graduate and go on to school. Yeah. But it also depends on where they start are and how old they are. I started with the one and a half year old, didn't last too long, because he cried. But he's, he, his treatment plan was planned out for three years. So I was like, okay, and I also started with a seven year old and she was done within like two months. Like I worked on her for two months. And they were like, okay, she doesn't need to be here.

Simon Cullen  
What does she achieve after two months that made people think she was good to go?

Speaker 2  
So she, she was she wasn't, she started off. I'm not gonna say it's nonverbal. But she had like, very little words. So when I started working with her, she was making full sentences. She was talking to me like we were besties. And she had known me for five years. She was very, she was very functional child. So like, the the task and the targets that we had it just like it's no need for you to be here you go somewhere where they can meet, meet you where you are, and push you to where you have to be because we don't know that we can

Simon Cullen  
do. Yeah, that must be a good feeling. That's, that's great. So yeah, and you mentioned that you've been there for 10 months, and you said you only stay there that long because of these kiddos that you your clients. So how for how many years to RBTs typically stay on in the clinic, we've certainly been hearing a lot about burnout and turnover.

Speaker 2  
Whoo. Um, I will have to say that it would depend on how dedicated you are to the field. It definitely depends a lot on that because I started working with someone and when I started working with her, she had already been RBT, five years. So a year later, this is her sixth year. And you know, she's, she's doing great like she loves it. She is she's never leave it. If she goes back to get her bachelor's. She's never going to be a BCBA. But she doesn't she's like, No, I think I'm okay where I am. So that's fine. Um, but I also know of somebody who say for six months, and she was like, I'm sorry, I can't. So it depends on how dedicated you are. I definitely.

Simon Cullen  
Do you have a sense of like, what an average, what's more common? Is it more common to say the six months? Or is it more common to see the six years?

Speaker 2  
Oh, stick to the six year side? It's like very rare that I see somebody leave after like, a couple of months. It was very rare.

Simon Cullen  
Okay, that's, that's, that's pretty good. So would you say for an average, I could put down two years or three years or something like that? I would say three. Okay, cool. So would you say that the level of staff turnover and burnout is concerning? Yes. Yes. Do you want to talk to me a bit about that,

Speaker 2  
um, the previous center where I was, we were, we were understaffed at some point. And then we got staffing up a little bit. And then we lost our center manager. So we went out of city manager, and we were short staffed once again. And then we lost the BCBA we had to BCBAs over 15 Kids and about four RBTs

Simon Cullen  
Wow. Wow. 

Unknown Speaker  
So we

Speaker 2  
were we were dying and it was concerning because the kids weren't getting what they need it so Mark excited about them and you know them progressing. So I want to say that was like the most concerning for me is more likely to always revert back to the kids but it was is I mean,

Simon Cullen  
that makes perfect sounds that you're most concerned about the kids for sure. I'm sure it was hard for everyone involved though. But what you know what sort of things were most concerning with the kids you mentioned, you saw like some regression and things like that.

Speaker 2  
You have regression, you also have parents, parents. Parents played a huge role too. I worked with the kid who didn't have a morning RBT, I was at the new RBT. I worked on from 12 to three, love his mama, love his mother to death. I love her so to this day, but she she did, she was like, emailing, texting every day, like, hey, my son is covered. And I'm just like, I'm sorry, I'm not like, is nothing that I can do. If I could take him? You know, for that morning session, I would, but I can't like I'm sorry. So it was the parents. And also

Speaker 2  
so that was with the current the previous job. So with the current job, unfortunately, if a therapist is out, that kid can still be in the center. No. But we have gotten to a point where this was maybe recently, maybe about two and a half weeks ago, there was only two RBTs in the center. And there were seven kids, me and another RVT. And there were seven children, most of the children are they have like major behaviors. So you get four of them and major behaviors, and there's only two of us. And then the other three are just you know, maybe crying or wine and they don't want to hear all the noise. And that was probably the most stress I have ever been. 

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, I

can't imagine.

Speaker 2  
I was like, I don't I don't know, this is what I want to do. But I stuck it out. But I know for a fact I was just like, This is not right. Like send them home. You shouldn't be overworking me if you're not overpaying me.

Simon Cullen  
And I mean, you might just also worry about did you say it was four, four RBTs or two RBT? Two, two. I mean, you might worry if you've got seven kids, like you said major behaviors, I assume you mean things like self injurious behaviors, or escape behaviors or stuff like that? I mean, maybe there's also concerns just about the kids and whether or not it I mean, it seems totally unfair to the RPTS. But yeah, I wouldn't be worried about the kids as well. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm gonna ask you more questions about all of that in a bit, but I feel like we're gonna have a very interesting discussion. So but let me just step back. So generally speaking at the clinic you're at now do you feel respected by your work?

Speaker 2  
Absolutely not? No, absolutely not. I know, for a fact. I am not respected.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. How does that come out?

Speaker 2  
Um, well, I won't say. It's just like, you know, everybody. The parents, I love them. Of course, I love the kids. But management wise. It's terrible, isn't how it is. And right now, there aren't any in Jacksonville, there aren't many places to go. So I have to stick it out where I am and pay my bills. So

Simon Cullen  
what what sort of problems have you have with management?

Speaker 2  
But at first started, I was given like a heads up. We have a director who's a BCBA. And then we have a another BCBA. Um, so there's two BCBAs. I want to say eight children. And there are six RBTs. We're losing. We lost one Monday, and we're losing another one tomorrow. So when I first started, I was given a heads up about the second BCBA. They were just like, hey, you know, she hasn't been here. We don't know if she's come in. And they haven't seen her for months. So you have a BCBA you haven't seen her for months. She's not doing supervision. So you're not meeting that supervision percentage. So now I'm concerned and I'm just like, um, my credentials cannot be revoked because you don't want to supervise. Um, so I met with her, and I didn't get like a very welcoming, like vibe from her. She was very standoffish, um, and she stuck to one RBT. Like, you can tell that they were like really close. They probably hung out outside of work or something. And she was like, you know, if I went to her with a question, it was just like, I'm dealing with her right now. And I'm just like, Okay, well, the kids are suffering and it's not me. Like you don't have to help me but you need to help the kids. I started with my first kid. And she has 76 targets on our program. When I started with her And I was so overwhelmed, because I'm just like, you want me to run 76 targets 10 trials a day? I don't know who you think I am. But I am not Superwoman. Like, I don't know, we can multiply account. But that's a lot of work to do in an eight hour period, like, Um, no. So I took it upon myself to just text the group chat, and I'm just like, hey, you know, can we have a meeting? Because there's a lot of stuff that's going on. And I'm just not comfortable with how things are being run, and y'all have children that have autism. So I was met with no, like, we're not having, we're not talking to you. And it was just like, very quick, it was very combative. And I'm not the type of person that does, I don't have a conflict very well. But I'm also not going to let you like, you know. So I was just like, I don't understand why it's an issue. If I'm asking questions, or I need help, and I need some understanding, I've come into who is supposed to be helping. And I didn't get that. So after that, I was calling professional. Because I stated issues that were wrong. And I knew they were wrong, and they weren't supposed to be happening. I was called a professional. I actually just recently got into another verbal altercation with the same supervisor. She came to the center. And we had a previous situation, when she came in after another four months of being gone. We'd love that. And she came in, and I was eating breakfast, my kid was eating breakfast. And she was like, You need to sit by your kid. It was just in that manner. And I'm just like, well, she's eating breakfast, there's no seat next to her, I'm sitting directly in front of her, I'm just giving her a space. You need to sit next to your kid. And I'm just like, you know, she's okay. But you also there's a way that you talk to people, like I'm not, I'm not a disrespectful person, you don't have to disrespect me. So after that, I went to the director, I'm just like, listen, I can't do it, her if she can't respect me, like, if she can't respect me, I'm not gonna respect her. So it's best that you just keep us in separate quarters. Unfortunately, he said that he would. And he did not hold up or that. So last week, this is actually last week. She was there from the 21st to that Friday, I'm not sure what day that was. And that prior week, we had a meeting, and she came in and she was just like, I just want to know what the issue is because he let me know that Jordan won't be here in which we actually did not want her there. And so we went around the table, and they got to me, and I made sure to pay attention. I'm a very observant person, I made sure to pay attention to everybody else, when they were talking and what she was talking. So everybody else were on that phone while she was talking. And you know, they were doing what they wanted to do. So I made sure that, you know, pet keep noted that because I know how she is when it comes to me. So it got to me, and I'm just like, I don't really know how we can move forward from you know, the stuff that you said and done to me. But if I have to deal with you, that's fine. Like, I can coexist as long as we keep the respect, you know, as respect. So she let everybody talk, it got back to her to talk. And she got to me and my points. And she raised her voice, I noticed her voice got way louder than what everybody else, she started doing this. And I was just like, you don't have to do that with me. Because I'm not a confrontational person. Like, I didn't do that. And I didn't raise my voice. Nobody wants to fight. So after she did that, I just took it upon myself. I was like, Listen, I'm not going to go back and forth with you. If this is how you're gonna respond to me like, I don't do that. So I just I was like, I'm just going to conversation, you can finish what you have to say, but I don't have anything else to say. So I said, I sat down, I looked at my phone, I picked it up. And I just placed it back down just to check my notifications because my mom had just text me. And she was like, see, that's so disrespectful. You own your phone. Like, I literally picked it up and put it down. I didn't touch I didn't unlock it. I didn't answer the phone. And I was so shocked. And I'm just looking at everybody else's reactions and they're just like, What is going on? So I'm like, Okay, this is when I'm gonna just gonna remove myself from conversation in general, because you're not gonna yell at me like I'm your child, and you're 31 and I'm talking to my Mama, don't even talk to me like that. So I'm sorry, I can't do it. So I was like, I'm just gonna remove myself because I can't do it. I was like everybody else while you were talking to them. We're on their phones. I literally have a message from somebody that you were talking to. And she was texting me while y'all were talking and She was like, No, that's not true. Nobody else will know that bombs like, and this is where I'm gonna start talking to you because I know I'm right. And I know you're incorrect. And after that I didn't say anything else, or I also dealt with her. But what I will say is when I decided to leave, she had something happen.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah, that sounds really, I'm I don't even know how to describe it very difficult at all. I mean, I'm kind of curious. You have like, Do you have a any hypothesis as to why this? This culture is so dysfunctional? I mean, so many things you just said in that story are big red flags. What's Do you have a sense of what's going on at the highest level?

Speaker 2  
Honestly, I don't know. With her. I know, it's more so of, you know, because she's a black woman. She feels like she has to put on that. That armor of like, yeah, you know, I'm the, the black BCBA. It's not that many of us. And it's just like, it's okay. Because when she she pulled me to the side one day, she was just like, I tried to put all the black women in the office, you know, just to talk to y'all. And I'm just like, why is it just us, like, that made me uncomfortable. Like, don't, don't try to single me out and make me feel like, you know, I'm just an angry person. I'm not, I'm not angry person at all. But I was just like, you're just pulling us in office to talk to us and don't don't like don't try to pull the black economy. I'm sorry, it's not gonna work. So, honestly, before that, I never really had any issues with BCBAs at the previous center. And then I got to her and I was just like, Oh, my God, she's gonna put me in jail. In jail.

Simon Cullen  
That's wild. Well, I'm, I'm sorry to hear that. Very impressed that you're still hanging in there. All right, well, I'm gonna in the next section, I want to ask you a bit about your training as an RBT. So thinking about the both the training and the education provided by the BAC B and by your first supervisor. Do you think that your training prepared you well, for your first day working with clients?

Speaker 2  
Yes. Um, well, with the 40 hour training, it did help. It definitely did. I've definitely learned a lot of stuff that I didn't know. But I'm also I'm like, 50%, you know, electronic, but also, like this percent hands on. So I was like, super grateful that I had hands on BCBAs at my first center, because they taught me a whole lot. Like minor corrections. I had one. Well, she was actually the center manager, but she was still a BCBA. She asked me Well, I started working with the kid, and he cried a lot. And it was around like my first two months of working there, I was still getting used to stuff getting the hang of things. And every time he pulled up to the center, he just and I never knew why. But eventually he did grow out of it, you know, he sent me and it wasn't cries anymore. It was just, Hey, girl, I'm ready to go. I first started working with him, he cried every single morning. And one morning, I think I was just having a rough day. It was it was I was just tired. And I was just like, Oh my God. She ended up pulling me to the side, maybe like an hour later, she was like, hey, you know, next time, you know, I understand, but just you know, do it in your head. So at that time, when she corrected me, because I was still like, upset. I didn't take it well. But I also didn't, you know, talk back and be like, you don't know what you're talking about. I took it, I received it. And once I thought about it, she was right. Like, you know, you'd have to correct yourself sometimes. But I really did appreciate that.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, I've definitely heard from, you know, a lot of IBTs who didn't get that hands on training at the beginning. And boy, did they pay for that? So it sounds amazing that you you had someone that who was going to correct you and was going to give you like not just the the terminology and all that but actually how do you work with these clients? I'm kind of interested, you know, imagine you like the new dictator of the BAC B and you could redesign the training requirements for new abilities. You know, what would you do? How would you change it? What would you want to put in place?

Speaker 2  
Oh, honestly, I would. I don't know how I know every scenario and you know, every company does not work the same. So with my first company, they did a chat Don't sessions before you start working with the kid. So I would do that, but I would make him like a broader does. That makes sense, because when you go test it for RB devices, you're not one person in there. So I feel like if the people who I tested with and they didn't receive that training, I feel like we should have like a, you know, at least wherever ABA is, is where a training center should be, like more hands on and shadow sessions, parents, you know, signing that consent form, yes, I'm comfortable with my kid, you know, being, you know, in a place where RBTs are being trained. I feel like that would be very important. And it would make a big difference, because I've met RBTs, who don't have the same training as I do. And they need those corrections that I had. And it's like, I don't want to correct you because, you know, for both parties. And I just wish it was just someone there that was there when I when I needed it.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I'm really interested in your answer to that question. Because I've, I've heard so many RPTS. Now, I've kind of just been shocked. My whole team has been a bit shocked, because we have these questions about training. And it's pretty rare to find someone who is like, I was trained effectively, I believe most RBTs are prepared from day one, to work with kids who might not be able to communicate and might engage. Not one really, very few people say yeah, I felt like that. And it feels it really seems like there's some structural issues. And I'm definitely interested to get your your take on that. So all right, you covered a lot of my questions that were on this page. That's great. I love that. Let me just fill that in. Yeah. All right. So did the training that you received either from the BAC B or from your first BCBA? Goodness, all these letters just

Unknown Speaker  
okay. I still get messed up too.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. Okay. Thank you, that makes me feel a little bit better. So, yeah, so the training for RBT is provided by the BAC B and also from the BCBAs. Do you think it addressed the potential for harm or abuse in ABA therapy? And what I mean by that is, do they ever talk about the ways that a b ABA can go wrong? Or could lead to clients being harmed?

Speaker 2  
I'm with my first company. Yes. Yes, um, I did have to actually get in, like, actually have that experience with the kid to honest, like, fully understand what they meant. But they definitely gave I very thorough descriptions, they gave very thorough training, you know, notes that if we needed them, even in central reach, like we had notes if we needed them. Because with some of those kids, you definitely needed a couple of notes. They did a great job with it,

Simon Cullen  
would you? That's fantastic to hear. And I'm I'm definitely interested to hear what sort of things they did. So what sort of descriptions notes were they giving you?

Speaker 2  
Um, let's see. I'm gonna see about Ben. So my most aggressive client that I had, he clearly he had more notes. But I wish I still had it in such a reach, but I'm going to try to break it down as best as I can. So basically, in his sets in his central route section, it would give the behavior that he had, you know how bad it can get. And then immediately after that, it's like, this is what you do. Like you do XYZ, if this doesn't work, Revert, revert to this, and that doesn't work. Let's start back over. And if we needed that, like help. I'll just use I'm also best client as an example. I had one one with him were probably shouldn't laugh, but it wasn't funny day, but I definitely laugh about it. Now. He was in a very he wasn't behaviors, but the bad one morning, he got to the point where he flipped the table, like the just flip it and he's four, he's not that big. He's not a big, he's fast. And he got away, but he's big, but he was very aggressive to the point where I would go home with scratches, big scratches across my face. And he came in one morning, and he was in behaviors a lot. So at the time, I was CPR certified, but I had never had to do a hold. I never had to do a whole with any of my you know, clients that went into behaviors because it never got to that point. And he was also for so I didn't too much want to, you know, do anything with him and I could possibly hurt him. So I did a call from my BCBA. And she came in and she said then, and she put him in a hole to where he's not hurting, because the hole that if I would have did it, the way that I was trying to do it, I probably would have hurt him. So she showed me she was like, you know, for him, we do this because he's a little bit different. He's a little bit smaller. So and he calmed down. I was just like, oh, okay, so after that, like he would he would go into his behaviors really bad. I would do that.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah. So how would you hold him.

Speaker 2  
Um, it was like, he would sit in between my legs, but I wouldn't put my legs across him, like, I will let him kick because his legs weren't all that long so and they weren't going anywhere. And it would have to be on a padded floor. So we grabbed the heat, he had a mat specifically for himself. So when he did kick, his foot didn't hit, you know, a towel floor. And I will just hold his arms by his side. And not too much pressure, but just enough to where he isn't stronger than me. And it was just like, Okay, well, I know, I can't move, I'm not going to fight you. So I'm just gonna sit here, and I'm gonna, we're gonna bring an accountant by the countless shapes, and he was fine. I'm just like, wow, wow, okay.

Simon Cullen  
All right. It's like, I'm trying to imagine what happens if there wasn't someone at your clinic who knew how to do that. So you were just talking to me, I think about the first company. All right. So can you talk about that question now in the second company, so just to remind it was, Do they ever talk about the ways that ABA can go wrong and can lead to clients being harmed? And maybe I'll add Avi T's being harmed as well.

Speaker 2  
Okay, um, can I get about 30 seconds?

Simon Cullen  
seconds if you want go for it. I'll be right back your time. Thank you time.

Okay, all right. So let's talk about the second company.

Unknown Speaker  
Um, what was the question?

Simon Cullen  
The question was, did the training provided, discuss the potential for harm or abuse in ABA therapy. And I think we should understand that to mean both of the clients but also have the abilities.

Speaker 2  
So with the second center, I hate to say it, but I wasn't trained very well, when it came to the children going into behaviors and what to do with that specific child, because every child is different and is, oh, wow, specifically at this center. They are very different. The kid that I work with, she goes into behaviors, she kicks, she hits the table, she likes to the screen, but she also likes to just run into stuff and just hit it with the back of her hand. I don't know what that's about. But she would just just just run into it. And then we also have another kid there. And his is just just extreme. I don't know how to explain it, because I've never worked with him. But it gets to a point where he has to be physically removed from rooms, and he has to be placed in his room, he may try to run out of the center sometimes. So his is just way more extreme than hers. But either way it goes, I wasn't trained properly on her behaviors and the RBTs were working with him. They're definitely not trained properly on his

Simon Cullen  
Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? Why do you say that?

Speaker 2  
Um, so when I first started this center, that was obviously there, she's now going. And he would go on to behaviors, and she would just let him sit there. And I was just like, Okay, well, you know, he's kind of interrupting, you know, other kids and they're in group activities and they can't focus and you also have another nonverbal. He doesn't like to hear a lot of noise. So now that he's screaming, you have a nonverbal kid, just, you know, and just screaming like, he doesn't want to hear that. And she was like, Well, I don't you know, I don't know what to do. And I was just like, Well, how long have you been here and she had been there for three years. She had been there for three years, she worked with him for three years. And she was never trained on you know, how to remove him if you need to. Or, you know how to how to respond to his behavior. Um, with the kid that I have. I wasn't given anything on her behaviors, I just kind of started winging it, in all honesty. So now, when she goes to behaviors, I just take her to the table. I found what I had to find what works for her. And I feel like that's kind of sad, because this is something because she's been here for years, this is something that should already be in, in some notes somewhere, you know, this is something that somebody should already know. So I have RBTs, coming to me, and I've been there since January, I haven't been that well. So RBTs has been there longer than I have, they will come to me. And they'll be like, you know, how do you get her to calm down? So is there a few days and I'm not there? I may have a I'm sorry, I just got odd message. And

Simon Cullen  
that's fine. You need to take take some time. Also, if you I am aware that the time and I, I hope you can give me an extra 1010 minutes. Because I feel like you got a lot to tell me. And I'm really interested. I'm certainly already learned a lot in the last 45 minutes. So if we can talk for another 10 minutes, that'd be great. But if you've got to go, oh, no, that's fine.

Speaker 2  
It was just a non non factor. It just threw me off for a minute.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. Well, I guess one question I have about this is, do you think that the circumstances could be dangerous, either for the RBTs? Or for the clients? Yes, yeah.

Speaker 2  
Um, I do believe that one day, that one of the kids will want the kid that's there that who books out of the door, he's gonna book it out of that door, and nobody's gonna see him. And when I am able to find him, he leaves home, he does it at home, like he leaves in the middle of the night and goes to the fire station. And they just bring him back. Last time, he did not make it all the way to the fire station, because he ended up with a nail in his foot. So I'm definitely concerned about that. And the RBT is not being trained, you know, if he books it, and they might be, you know, cleaning up accidentally yet. Now, it's nothing that they can do because they're trying to clean up poop off the floor. But he's already down the street. So yeah, I'm definitely concerned. And when it comes to the kid that I work with, are more concerned of her safety, just not for her. Well, not due to her like she does she she aggresses. You know, she has her SRBs. But it's never she just picks her skin right here because she has a bruise. And she just picks at it. But other than that she'll just smack the table or something. She never like hits herself. My concern with that is the director that's there. He's very aggressive with the children. So he gets to a point where but none of the kids like him, especially the female client says there. We have one, she's all verbal, she literally looks at him and will turn the other way. She's terrified of him. Like if I could explain her reaction to him very well. I could if I could record her I would. She's terrified. She doesn't like him. And then the kid that I work with, when she notices that her regular barbecues are not with her and his him, she gets upset. It's just automatic tears, like on cue as soon as. As soon as he she sees him. It's just like, I don't want to work for him. Somebody please come save me, please. And there'll be at the table. And she may go into this. She's upset, like she's already crying. And instead of him waiting for her to calm down, and then start her table session, he decides to egg it off a little bit more. So it gets to the point where he's she's already crying. They're sitting at a table, and he's like, take off your tokens and you know, because she's crying, she probably can't hear you. And so he's still like, take your tokens off and I'm just like, you don't have to talk to her like that. So I'm in another room with another kid. And like all you can hear is just her crying. And he'll be presenting the SD if she doesn't respond in a timely manner that he likes. And just to make things clear, she has a time delay of 10 seconds, she has 10 seconds to respond to a prompt pick up a SD that's given to her. He does not give her 10 seconds, he gives her two seconds and is you either got it or you don't. So an example would be like, he would like, touch car. And it does take her own longer time, which is why she has a 10 Second 610 Second time delay. It takes her a little longer for it to clear, she knows it. It just it's just like the process of it. She's like, Okay, give me a couple of seconds, and I got you. But um, if she's already crying, she might pick on her skin. And if he's presenting the SD, she's here, she's crying, he's immediately snapped to her hand. So yeah, I actually have a video of that. One of my co workers recorded it. And she sent it to me when I was out. So we reported it. I haven't heard too much back. And because he's a private company is also not too much a lot of people can do either. I didn't know that.

Simon Cullen  
This was my next question. So if you're observing this, I mean, it sounds pretty terrible. I know. And obviously, that's under describing it. But what are you meant to do when you are working somewhere? Where there's someone doing this with a disabled child? What are you meant to do it? So who did you report it to?

Speaker 2  
Um, oh, one is the site? Geez. Um, I don't want to say it's like the child abuse site. But

Simon Cullen  
Child Protective Services? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2  
It was a site that I reached out to my previous BCBA to get it from, because I couldn't, you know, go to him and be like, Hey, I'm trying to report you. So I got it from her. I did the reporting. And I hear anything back. So I'm just like, I don't know. And we just, we'll just have to go from there.

Simon Cullen  
I'm really sorry to hear you're dealing with that. But I'm also very, very happy to hear that you are in that clinic. Because I have heard stories as bad as that and even worse, and there hasn't been someone there to report it. So are you still there? Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'm so sorry. My own picture just came up to 10. hide that. So I don't look at myself. Yeah. So I'm really glad you are there. And I'm sorry, you're working in those circumstances? That sounds pretty bad. Yeah, okay. Well, I can certainly see why the kids are terrified at the sky. So when a child is having, you know, these behaviors, maybe starting to amplify the self injurious behavior behaviors. They're still trying to do trials. Did I understand that? Right. So, right? And is, is this the same clinic where I think you said it was, like 64 targets or something?

Unknown Speaker  
What is actually the same kid?

Simon Cullen  
That's the same kid? You know, one thing I have started to wonder when hearing some of these stories is how much of the kids behavior is actually a reaction to the attempt to administer the therapy, like kind of driving the kids to escalate and causing some real distress? Do you have a reaction? Do you have a feeling about that? Am I? So like, how do I react? No. I mean, do you think that I mean, like, I'm just I've obviously not been in one of these clinics. I just talked to dozens of RBTs and heard heard them telling stories, and I'm finding myself thinking more and more, maybe some of the behaviors that they're talking about, like the amplifying self injurious behaviors that like really wild tantrums and uncontrollable screaming, uncontrollable crying. Sometimes it seems to me like maybe that's the kid responding to this therapy, you know, because the trial they're doing dTT and they're just doing trial after trial to trial and the kid is showing sounds to me like I'm listening to it. I'm going this child sounds like they're showing you that they really need some time to cool off. Do you ever feel like maybe the therapy is being delivered in a way that is actually making these problems worse?

Speaker 2  
I've actually had a kid who needed a break. Previous Senator, we were almost like, we gave him a break, but his mom was just with my BCBA to talk to his mom, because he's in speech and OT and a you have ABA. So it was a lot for him. He's four years old. Let's take them on vacation. Let them get signed. Let him feel son let him touch Stan. Something because, like they're still children. Like they get tired. They get wore out just like everybody else and It's like it's a job to them. Like that's pretty much what it is. So yeah, they Yes, please give them a break.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah, yeah. All right. I'm glad. Glad you, you seem like Yeah, well, you even said you, you're you're very perceptive, and I have a great. Alright, so I'm mindful of the time, I know I've got another one starting in a minute, I want to get as much from you as I can. So let me just get scroll through to my next section and see what I want to get into. Because you've told me lots of interesting stuff. It's sort of all over the shop. And I'm really grateful for us, I just want to say what I can make out of the last few minutes of your time that I got here

by I'm interested to talk about stimming behaviors, if you ever work on stimming behaviors, or if you have other RBTs stimming behaviors, I'm definitely interested in that.

Speaker 2  
I'm, I actually have worked with a lot of swimmers. And me personally, if I had to choose, like, the best part of being RBT is to see it, like I genuinely enjoy seeing children's stamp do. Um, so I had a child. I still talk to his mom still to this day. I love him to death. And he had like very nice stems. So he would always just, um, and that was just it. And he would just go back to what he was doing. And I was like, but it was always just like he would walk up to you just smile, and just and just go back and I was just like, are you okay? Do you need anything? But it was just like, No, he just likes to stem and I'm just like, okay, like, I genuinely enjoy seeing it. So I think it's cute.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. And so I'm wondering, do you know if any of your colleagues or the people at the clinics that you work with work with kids to try and alter their stimming behavior? Or to sort of suppress it or teach them to control it in different circumstances? It may be people who have a very different take on it to yourself?

Speaker 2  
Um, not that I know of like, not that I can like recall. I haven't I haven't seen, you know, I haven't seen it yet. Maybe it's because like, the stamps aren't, you know, up there?

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off.

Speaker 2  
Oh, yeah. I haven't seen it. No, not yet. One of

Simon Cullen  
the things I've really come across as I've gotten more and more interested in ABA and and I started listening also to autistic people who got the treatment as kids, and now they grow up. And they're sort of reflecting on it. And one of the things that they talk about a lot is ABA therapists trying to train them to stop stimming. And they explain this is really harmful, because they're like, if I seem to calm myself down, like they say, I like some of them say that stimming helps me concentrate, like, you know, if I'm trying to focus and you make me, you know, so I've been really interested to talk when I talked to the deputies now to sort of ask them, like, you know, how do they react to something I gotta say, I don't think anyone on my team has ever I don't think we've ever met anyone who actually appreciates the stimming game so that more and more examples of RBT that I'm talking to right now. So all right. I am just going to quickly scroll through here. Boy, I wish we had more time.

Speaker 2  
I do have a question. Oh, I know like the site. Let's let it get together. The site lets you book like, different times on different days. So are there different students?

Simon Cullen  
Just give me one moment I've just got somebody in the in the waiting room and I'm just going to send them a message and just say I'll be right with them so they don't leave.

Unknown Speaker  
Message

Simon Cullen  
Okay, could you repeat your question for me?

Speaker 2  
Oh, so when I looked at the site, I believe I think that email yesterday, and it lets you book like ebooks for today is six and then I think I booked for tomorrow. So is it for students?

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. So I'm the I'm supervising the whole thing. Okay. So yeah, my students are, I'm sure they would love to talk to you even more actually. Come back. I was also thinking I might, I might. I would be grateful if you were happy to chat with me a bit more. But maybe let's close this interview out. I gotta read you a little bit of stuff. and ask for your permission for a few things. So I'm going to do that. And then maybe we can email. And if you want to keep chatting with me, I'd love that if you want to meet one of my students, absolutely. But let me just get that get that pod. So we can close this out, and I got the next person I got to talk to. So I'm just gonna get down to the go. All right. Okay, so I would like to address any questions you have for sure. But we're just running a little short on time. So I want to ask if you will be comfortable with my team sharing and anonymized transcript of today's interview with other interested people, like researchers at my own institution, just to be very, very clear with you. Like I said at the beginning, this would never include any details that could be used to identify you. I have been listening to, as I always am to say, if you accidentally say something that might give away your work, I haven't heard you do that. You will read through the transcripts again, to make sure I take it like I said very, very seriously. So is that okay with you? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, great. And what about the audio recording? Would you be happy with? Yeah. Okay. You can say no, say no, if you don't,

Unknown Speaker  
no, no, I promise. It's okay. It's okay. Okay.

Simon Cullen  
I really don't want you to feel any any pressure. I was

Speaker 2  
actually a little like, I enjoy us like things like this. So when it came up, it was just like, it's a nice opportunity. So yes, it's perfectly fine.

Simon Cullen  
Yeah. Well, thank you so much for talking. If you want to talk a bit more, I definitely got more questions for you to shoot, shoot us an email, and I'll spot that and then I'll make sure I can find a time when you're available. I'd love to keep talking. But thank you so much for the time you've given to this project. I really appreciate it. And I'm going to keep an eye out for your email. And even if I don't see it in the fall, when we prepare our report. I'll be sharing that with you. And if you have any thoughts or reflections on it, I would love to hear about them then so maybe we can talk again at that point, if not sooner. All right. Thank you so much for your time.

Unknown Speaker  
You're welcome. Thank you. Bye bye.
