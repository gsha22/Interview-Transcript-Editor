Lily  
I just have to ask again on video. Are you happy for this to be recorded? Yes. Okay. Okay, so yeah, we're just gonna start off with some simple questions about like, your background or training, education, all that and, um, but yeah, this is just about like your experiences and kind of what you've, like, seen her and all that stuff. So

Unknown Speaker  
awesome.

Lily  
Yeah. So where in the United States do you work?

Unknown Speaker  
I work in Bend Oregon. Okay.

Lily  
And what's the highest level of education, you've

Unknown Speaker  
received? A high school diploma?

Lily  
And for how many years? Have you been working with clients? Two and a half years? And where do you deliver therapy?

Speaker 2  
And a ABA based clinic setting? Or it's sometimes in home sessions? Okay. Yeah, yeah.

Lily  
And what credentials do you hold from the DHCP?

Unknown Speaker  
My RBT credential. Okay.

Lily  
And do you plan on becoming a BCBA? Yes. Awesome. And what inspired you to become an RVT?

Speaker 2  
Um, the company that I'm at is a LLC, so they're privately owned, and the people that I worked with there, because the husband and wife that own it are both BCBAs. And that I'm so sorry. Am I answering the wrong question?

Lily  
No, I was actually curious about both, like, become a BCBA. And like, why you got in the field? So

Speaker 2  
yeah. And so when I met them, and we were talking and like, just kind of seeing I really love the job. And then I I'm really interested in the like, making a behavior intervention plan or doing parent training or stuff like that. And so I like the direct therapy, but I want to do more beyond that.

Lily  
Okay. Yeah. Yes. And how did you get involved in like ABA in

Speaker 2  
I grew up like babysitting kids that had special needs and stuff like that. And then I was looking at jobs that work with kids. And I initially worked at a clinic called card, which was like a big worldwide one, or Center for Autism and Related Disorders. And they popped up on Indeed, and I didn't know that they were in our town, because in Bend, we only had three ABA clinics in the whole town. And so when that one popped up, I applied with that, because they funny enough had the best like onboarding for somebody that's ever been in the field. Like all that training that they provided. Yeah. Yeah.

Lily  
I mean, I was just going to ask you about like the training. So like, considering the training from the BAC B, and by your first supervisor, do you think it was, like, sufficient for like, it prepares you? Well, for the first day?

Speaker 2  
Yes, it was interesting, because it was coming out of COVID. So it was in a zoom group. And they had us do that for a week. And we all and I liked that I liked that participating in like a group discussion or like group learning, almost like you were in a classroom. And then I had to take my ID ticket test before I could start, because in Oregon, they require you to get like a RB AI certification in order to be billable by insurance. And so we had to have class for a week, essentially, then take a test and pass that then we could start working. And then when we started, they had us go through a checklist. And so the second week, we were, like, overlapped by the trainer at the company. And we had to check off all of our checklists. And then we were able to start like one on one direct therapy by ourselves. And I felt like that one was great, because we got so much support through it all and always had somebody there because I also hadn't worked with kids in a while. And so it was like, okay, like, When can I pick them up? Or when do I just leave them alone? Or how do we do this? And so I think that was great. And then they even had, the company had their own set of like training videos that were always accessible. And so the, the company that I was just at, or I'm at right now, they don't have that because it's a small company. And so the difference in training was like drastic.

Lily  
Yeah. Do you? Like, it sounds like that first company provided a lot of extra training. Yeah, I think like, without that, it would have been a lot different.

Speaker 2  
Yes. 100%. And I feel like something to that kind of lacks, even though I've only been at two companies in the same town. They don't really go over how to write your notes for insurance. They just tell you, Oh, insurance is going to read them so make them good, but some People would be like, Oh, the client had a great day. And then that would be their whole note. And that's not, you know. And so I think that the first company went above and beyond to make sure everyone was prepared. And then the second company, not their fault, it's just hard for them to, I guess, find all of the training that could be needed. They use a lot of like, autism partnership Foundation, because it's free. And it's great. But on the list on the bseb, they're like, 16th, on the list of if you use this form to train for your RBT. Like, you have like a 60% chance of passing. So it's not like the best form of like training.

Lily  
Yeah, okay. Yeah. And kind of going back to like, I just have a few questions about, I think I skipped over, I'm sorry, but more into the training. Because we're interested in looking at whether RBCs are like treated and paid fairly for the work that they do. So if you're comfortable, like what was your starting salary as in your very first position as an RVT.

Speaker 2  
My starting salary is RBT was 21 an hour. And for where I was at, like, I've just I've moved recently, but when I was out there, that was a very, like, fair wage. The only hard thing was it was once a month payments. And so it would be great to you know, get your whole sum, but it was always like the 25th of the month. So it was late. Like, yeah, yeah, but and then at the first company card, they I'm only name dropping them because they're, they're going out of business. But they started your pay at 1475. And then if you became an RVT, you would get bumped up to 16. And I don't think that was a fair wage at all.

Lily  
Okay, so is the 21. Your current? Yes. Okay. So you said you started at like, 1475? Or

Speaker 2  
Yeah, 475. And then once you became an RVT, you got 16. And then at my company that I'm at now, they started people with experience at 18. And then once you got your RVT, you got 21. Okay.

Lily  
Yeah. And did either of these positions provide health insurance?

Speaker 2  
Yes, the will the, the one that I'm currently at does the card did not require give

Lily  
benefits? Okay. And you said that one's going out of business?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, there. They just went into they filed like, class two bankruptcy. So they're getting rid of their debt and then selling but it's not going to stay like an ABA company.

Lily  
Okay. All right. And is that why, like, is that where you left? Or you said, you moved?

Speaker 2  
I left a month before they said they were closing the company that I'm at now. They just they're new, they just opened up in Bend. They're based out of Eugene, Oregon, and then we're able to open up a clinic and bend. So when I just left because I wanted to get in on like, a really good company that gave benefits and offered higher pay. Yeah,

Lily  
absolutely. And so how many hours a week do you work in total?

Speaker 2  
I work about 36 hours. I'm only Monday through Thursday. And then Fridays are reserved if I want to do like if I was out sick, or the client was out sick, then I have a few hours that I can make up a session.

Lily  
Okay. Yeah. And because I know that for some clinics, you don't get paid if they cancel is that

Speaker 2  
currently at the clinic I'm at that they do pay us but all the other clinics do not so and then I've moved recently or I'm like, about to move and so I I know that like the next clinic I go to they're not gonna pay for that. It was like very special. Yeah, yeah. And then they also some clinics will do. If you're not in a session, they pay you minimum wage. So if you're not billing insurance, they won't pay you your actual rate, you only get minimum wage for like, if you stayed late to clean or if you had a cancellation in New York state until like do office time. It would only be minimum wage.

Lily  
Okay. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And for how many hours per week do you work with an average client?

Speaker 2  
Um, say? Like, I'd say eight hours. Okay, because we do our schedules are mirrored. So whoever I have on Monday, I also have on Wednesday, and then whoever I have on Tuesday also have on Thursday. Yeah.

Lily  
So how many like clients are you currently working with? I have have six clients? Oh, wow. Okay. That seems like a lot is that does that

Speaker 2  
like, well, it's three, it's three on Monday. And then like, it's different set of three on Tuesday and then the same three on. Okay. Yeah, Wednesday. And it's really nice the way that my schedule works. They do, like block time. So my sessions are always 845 to 1130. And then I have a lunch break. And then I have like, 1215 to 245. And then I have another break and drive time if I'm out somewhere, and then I do 330 to six. Okay. Yeah. And so they're always scheduled in that timeframe. And then I always have scheduled breaks or scheduled time to drive to get there. Okay, yeah, it

Lily  
seems organized. Yeah, it's really nice. Yeah. But is it like challenging to work with six different children?

Speaker 2  
It is, I feel like at first, like when I was first put on all of them, and like starting, but then after a while, it's really like, easy to find that routine. And this company is great about supervision. So at least once a week, I'm with like, my BCBA. Or if a new person is they're like, oh, come out with me. And like, we get to do it together. And so it's nice, because I never because I had a lot of home sessions for a while. It was nice, because I wasn't I didn't feel like alone, like just sent off at a house somewhere.

Lily  
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And considering, like, all the places you've worked, like, on average, like, do you see a concerning level of burnout or staff turnover?

Speaker 2  
Yes. And I also see where I feel like who's hiring can sometimes get a burnout because sometimes people come and they don't even know, like, I had one of my co workers be like, Oh, I didn't know I was going to potty train. And that's a big part of ABA, especially early intervention. Yeah. And, and it's hard, because I feel like people that come in, that don't have any experience with this. They, if they need like that big training. And right now at my company, they only give them the 40 hour training from autism partnership. And so then they essentially say, okay, sit and then watch these 40 hours of videos, and then you can come work here, but they don't test them beforehand. And I know like, watching something and taking a test sometimes doesn't work for people. That's not like a benefit. But then sometimes people don't actually watch the videos, and then they just show up to work. Yeah,

Lily  
yeah. Yeah. And so do you think that's like part of the reason about the staff turnover and burnout, like people don't really know what they're getting into?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, I think for people that are new to the field, and then people that are just like switching companies. i The one that I'm out right now, the four days a week and having like a three day weekend like that super helpful. They also follow certain school holidays. So like when around Christmas time, we get two weeks off, if we want it. So we can choose to take it off, or we can work and then just take off like Christmas Day and Christmas Eve. And so they really try and set it up where like every two months, we get at least like two days optional off or up to a week. And so that type of scheduling is really nice. But then the cut back is it's really hard to request certain times off because they give us optional time. And so they're trying and I really liked that they're working on that. But then sometimes you get people that have requested stuff off month, months in advance, and then they were sick for a week and then their time off. And then this so then all the people that are there have to cover everything for them. And I think that really rises the burnout when like one person take all this time off. And then everyone else having to pick up the slack, essentially.

Lily  
Yeah. So have you had to, like cover for people in the past?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, there was a little bit. My job right now I was taken off some of my clients. And I was put as like a floater because we just had so many people out. And so my schedule was just covering a bunch of different kids. And that was hard because they're not like the kids I know. And it's like, okay, you have him for one day, and then her for a day and then tomorrow. It's all different. Yeah. And then there's some kids that are really high energy. And then there's some therapists that are high energy. And so the companies like to be like, Oh, you guys have high energy. You're on there all the high energy kids cases, and that can burn somebody out in like a week, because they're just always running around and don't have time to do their notes or put in data.

Lily  
Yeah. And do you find that you ever get burnt out?

Speaker 2  
I definitely did at my last company. And my last company didn't have block schedules. So it would be like you I have a four hour session, and then I'd have an hour session. And then I'd have like a two hour session, and then another four hour session. And they didn't give you scheduled breaks. They gave you a break, buddy. And you had to, like, find that person and leave your client with them, and then take your break. And yeah, so it's very interesting. And so I definitely at that company, I got like a, an attendance notice or something because my attendance was dropping. And I was like, Yeah, I don't really want to, like, come here and be thrown around all day. Yeah. And thankfully, our HR lady there, she was really understanding about that. And she was like, Okay, if that if that if you're feeling like that, like, come talk to me, and we'll figure something out. I don't feel like I had to talk to her again about it. But it's sad, because I feel like in the clinic, like people do get it. But just like, it's hard to give somebody like, work, leave or change something to give them a break. At my current company, I feel like they really listen to like the RBTs or BTS that are always one on one with the clients. And so like this one, I'm not burnt out, but I definitely have been. And sometimes it catches up to me. And so it's nice to have a three day weekend, or it's nice for like that optional week to hit and then I don't have to work for a week.

Lily  
Yeah, absolutely. And I'm curious, like, you're kind of talking about like, like whether or not they listened to you. So how is that different? For like, you kind of already answered this, but like, how did supervision look different? Or you're like first company as opposed to No,

Speaker 2  
it was really interesting, because a lot of and then when in locally, just one not one clinic, close the car clinic, everyone came to the new one that I was at. And it was funny, because when all of those BCBAs were doing, like the correct amount of supervision by old coworkers were like, are we in trouble? Like, why are in so much? Yeah. And so at my first company, unfortunately, we did not get appropriate supervision, they would only kind of come in when there was a behavior happening just to like check on us, which was nice. But it wasn't scheduled, like, Hey, I'm going to be with you this time. And this time, so we get our, like 10% supervision. But at my new company, there's like I said, I feel like once a week, I would see like my BCBA. Or we have to we had three at the time. And then we went down to two. And there was I was always seeing one of the three at least once a week. And they were always sitting that are sometimes going over. And I felt like they were really good at If anytime like it was like a first home session, they would always come out the first couple of days to make sure it was good. And they were really interested in our feedback about things where they'd asked us like, Oh, I'm trying to add like a new tacking program, what do they like to play with. And so we had a lot of input on their lesson. So it was easy for us to run, it wasn't just, oh, I made this whole thing like figure it out. And they the we used a program called Central reach. And so they would fill out on the side all of the program details and exactly how to run it and examples. And so it was almost like when they came for supervision. There wasn't anything wrong with the program or anything like that. So it was mostly just like anything new. They wanted to add or going over VB map. And so it was really nice because they would come for supervision like they needed to, but nobody had a bunch of questions or needed a bunch of help. In certain areas, it was very easy to like get your supervision and move on to other things like broader than just focused on the client.

Lily  
Yeah. And like did both companies ask for your feedback? Or

Speaker 2  
no, just this one that I'm at right now. The first one was very a little it was a corporate company and so they had I obviously a lot more like stuff that they had to do and like meet marks too. And so I feel like that faltered a little bit in there, like trickle all the way to the BTS. But it was they would come in intervene and behaviors and so that was helpful, but I didn't feel like it was teaching moments for the BCBAs to show the BTS how to deal with that on their own. It was more like hey, I'm here. I'll take over and then you like, just observed

Lily  
Yeah. Interesting. And in what ways do you wish that was like different?

Speaker 2  
Um, right one of my BCBAs right now she's very good at asking like, do you want me to step in? Do you want me to walk Keep through it, you want me to model it? And then you do it. And she's like, all of them asked, like, how do you like to learn? Like, how can we best support you? And they. And so then if there was a behavior happening, and my one BCBA, she was like this, one of my clients was having a new behavior. And it was like a lot of like, physical aggression. And she was like, I really don't like you guys to get hit. And I want to figure out his bed. So like, nobody gets hit. And so she's like, I'm gonna step in, if you're okay with that, because she didn't want anybody getting hurt, because she wanted to figure out how to make the bid. And I appreciated that because it wasn't like, Oh, I got it. I'm the BCBA. It was like, I'm, I'm here to help. And I don't want you to get like injured, essentially. So I like that stuff, and how I feel like, together with the BCBAs at this company, it's like teamwork. And then I felt like at the last company, it was like, Oh, they're my boss, and I'm below them.

Lily  
Yeah, that's interesting. It sounds like, it's funny. It's kind of sounds like the first one. Like, there was a lot of training, but not a lot of supervision. But now at this one, it's like, yes.

Speaker 2  
Okay, it's nice, because I feel like, because I started at that one with all of the positive training, and it took, like, I was like, Oh, my gosh, this is so hard to get a job. Because of all the training that happened, but it was so nice. And so now at this company, even because I've had such good training, I feel like it's, it's great for me at this one. But for people starting at this company, it's hard for me, I think it takes them a while to get their bearings, because of the training not being great. And they use the same 40 hours from on his partnership to train new hires. And then once that new hire wants their RBT, they have to watch the same 40 hours. So it's not different. Yeah.

Lily  
Okay, that just seems like a waste of time.

Speaker 2  
Yeah. And then instead of just having them watch it and get their RVT. And then yeah, it's because like, because they don't test them. Either. They're like, after the videos, there's like a little like, three question quiz. But you can retake it or view the correct answers if you failed it, and then just redo it. So it's not like a hard test, essentially. And then, that also, I feel like creates burnout, because those videos are long and boring. And, and then to watch it the first time to get hired, and then to have to watch them again, just to get your RVT that I had a hard time for that. I took me a little bit to get my RBT because I don't want to watch the videos again.

Lily  
Yeah. And so do you think like new people that are coming to this current company that they're, like, properly prepared for the work?

Speaker 2  
I think they everyone thinks they are but then I think it's so different once you're in it and like doing it because I and that's something I would tell like, some of the people that overlap me, I'd be like, okay, like, this is making sense. I know you're getting it. Once you're in your one on one session, like you'll probably feel a little bit more comfortable, like trying to run things or making a mistake or running it wrong and stuff like that. But I think it definitely has them a little bit more like reserved or quiet or not, like ready to like jump in with the kid or even like start building that rapport, because I feel like it's so much information like just thrown at you. And if you're not like an auditory learner, it's not really going to soak in. Yeah. And we don't have, we have some like onboarding checklist. But it's not like our company and been to it because it's still new, like, we just got our like lead trainer put in that position. And so I think it's hard to because they let new people overlap, the whole team of therapists that are working, instead of just sticking with like the lead trainer and going through clients and sessions. And so it's like, people that overlapped. If you're not a trainer, you're not supposed to train them, but they asked you to talk to them about certain things. So then you are essentially training them. So it kind of there's like a weird communication going on there.

Lily  
Yeah. So have you ever had to do that? Like, basically train somebody?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, I've had people overlap me before. And I always I always tell them I'm like, How do you like to learn, but I'm not a trainer. So like, you can ask me questions, but if there's anything confusing, like check in with like our office manager, and stuff like that, and it is and it's hard because then you get sometimes they'll put a new person with somebody that's only been here two months, and then they think that they are training them so they're like trying to talk them about company policy about this? And it's like, No, we just need to talk about this client, because they might take the case. And, like, see if they have a question about running something. And that's like the main stuff or like, a big thing is having them just like take the data. But then sometimes people are like, Oh, well, they're new. They don't know how to take the data. And I don't want my data to be messed up. So yeah. So I just think that like, there's like a loss in communication a little bit once once they have people overlap. Yeah.

Lily  
And it sounds like it can add a little bit of stress. Is that true? Yeah, I agree with that. Okay. Yeah, cuz I mean, you already have enough on your plate. already.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah. Trying to run a session. Yeah. Yeah.

Lily  
And I'm curious whether like, because it sounds like you had a lot of training? Like, did that training prepare you to work with clients who might be like self injurious or violent?

Speaker 2  
Yes, I definitely think so. Especially at my first company card, they, they had their own training, too, for like, the ABM training. I can't remember what the acronym stands for, though. But it's like for the big intense behaviors. And we also had like a special room that was all like padded and soft, so that if they were having a behavior, and we weren't, because we that's the, I don't know if this is all the time, but like, the companies that I've worked out, it's like a no restraint policy. So like, we would never like hold them down. We are allowed to block their behaviors, but we wouldn't ever stop them. So that room was designed in case they were like, had like very escalated that we couldn't intervene right away, at least it was safe. So that if they were like head banging, or like flopping to the floor, it wouldn't hurt them, it would be soft. And so we had a big like day on the on like a Saturday we like for it was like from nine to five, we had like a training for those like in escalated behaviors. And then at my current company, they don't necessarily take severe behaviors. And so it was like, kind of like a step back from that, like, at most it was, like low intensity had been and stuff like that.

Lily  
Okay, yeah. I'm curious, like, with that, like room you had at the last company, like, did you ever have a case where you had to, like where the child's behavior was, like, significant enough to be put in that room,

Speaker 2  
we had one client that would just start his day in that room, not in a behavior where he would just stay in that room because he had, like, intense behaviors, and he had a hard time with peers. And so if like, if peers came in, he would start escalating. And so it was just safer for him to just start in there instead of like, trying to move him. And it never was to, like, serious a hard thing. We had tuition. We had like a low man where they would like run out of our building. And so that, yeah, now I'm thinking of, I think most of the biggest behaviors I've seen were at my first company. Okay. Yeah. And that was and that was maybe and that was why the BCBA is mostly stepped in for that because they were intense behaviors. Yeah, or it was always good to have like, two people for certain things. And we had in card was all ages. So we had some children up to like 15. And I'm more used to just early intervention and being with like, two to eight. And yeah, but in those behaviors, I always felt prepared to handle it or prepared to have like, well, I feel prepared to handle behaviors at this company at card since the BCAAs would always step in I was mostly just sometimes if a behavior started, it would be like Okay, any minute a BCBA will show up it'll be fine. Yeah.

Lily  
And I'm curious like, what, like the child that was start their day every like day in that room? Like what was their initial reaction? Like that room?

Speaker 2  
They didn't mind it as far as I know. i By the time I started there, that was kind of already his routine. So I don't know if they like initially didn't like it. It was usually our clinic was set up, obviously with like multiple different like rooms, styles and stuff. But when nobody was assigned a room so when they came in, they kind of got to pick where they wanted to start and choose which room they were in. So I don't know if he just started choosing that room and they were like, Oh, this actually works out really well. It's like keep doing that. But it was a it had like padding on the side. And so you could like take things to the wall really easy and he was really motivated by like hanging up pictures or hanging up his drawing And so he was usually excited to go in there or like he would like as soon as he walked in, he be like, we're going to the Blue Room and like, he was going, yeah,

Lily  
yeah. Interesting. And so but you said, like your current company, you don't really have to, you don't really handle that kind of like, I guess you could say extreme behavior.

Speaker 2  
Yeah, there was only one client that for a time was having some really intense behaviors. And that one was hard because it was going home. And you couldn't control the environment very well. Yeah, but other than that, like this company doesn't have, like high intensity behaviors. Okay. Yeah.

Lily  
And I'm also curious, like, with the training you received, did, did it ever, like, discuss the potential for like the harm or abuse of ABA therapy? Like?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, yeah. And it was it, they didn't touch on, like, the history of how it was, like considered abusive, and stuff like that. But we got this, there was this article, and I wish I could tell you the name of it, I'm so sorry. But it was, it was just essentially about like, how it should look like going into like talking to these kids and being with them. And it's like you your first like session with them, you shouldn't place a demand, you shouldn't do anything like you're following their lead, you're seeing what they like to play with. You're even like, it's kind of like a thing, like, Don't ask too many questions, because like, question our demands. And then if you like, try and do something like read their body language, if they pull away, if they do that, and there's a new thing called a scent based programming, it's like a s, s, e and t. And it's essentially like, the, if a client is like walking up to you, or stuff like that, they're giving you like, a scent essential, essentially, to like, play with them. Or if you're, like, going like high five, and they're giving you high fives, like they're ascending to that stuff. But if you like place a demand, and they like pull away, or they, like, look scared or something, they're taking that ascent away, so then you would also want to stop and take a step back. And my new company was really focused on doing that, because we always want to make sure that they were like, agreeing to us treating them, essentially. And so my new company, I feel like it's been very, very good about, you know, just the children are also people and individuals. And they can say yes or no. And we have to work around that. I feel like at my first company, it was a little bit more like, we need to make sure we maintain our control, like situational control. So it would be like, Hey, we have to pick up and if they had a tantrum about that, then we would go down to like, we pick up some, and then we'd say like, Okay, you just have to do these ones. They'd have a tantrum, we like pick up some more and be like, you'd have to pick up this one. And then we can do what you want to do. And it would be kind of like you just wait. Yeah, so it kind of like stopped this therapy session, essentially, and tell they did what you were asking. And that my new company, it's kind of like, okay, you don't want to pick up right now. But we can pick up in a little bit. So then once you find that reinforcer that they really, really want, then you can represent Oh, hey, pick this one piece up, and then we can have this and then it's not an issue anymore, because they they know what they really want. They didn't have to do it exactly when they didn't want to. But now it's like, Oh, hey, you really want this, we have to grab that really quick. And then you can have it. And then it's super easy. Whereas I think in the past, it was very much like, Okay, if you don't do this, then we're not doing anything. Like and I can wait all day. Like it wasn't a very, like, kind way I felt like to work on something. Yeah,

Lily  
yeah. And how do you think, like, between the two different companies and those two different techniques, like that's effect, like, can you see a difference in the way children like react to therapy?

Speaker 2  
I feel like that 100% Because I feel like there's a big difference in that. Because it's like, the goal is like, they're supposed to be like playing and having fun and learning not Oh, you learned and now you can play and have fun. It's like you want to mix it all together in there. And I feel like to there's a big difference in like the rapport that people have with the clients when it's set up differently because it's not like oh, if I don't do one thing they don't want they're gonna get mad at me and I can't play it's more like oh, we're playing Oh, I have to do this really quick and then I get to play more or Oh, I really want this new thing. I just have to do this super fast and then I get this and so I feel like the almost like the results just look better or like the way that the like Prague versus going. And then it's nice to because then you don't have to be the bad guy essentially, like, you can also have fun with them and keep it going

Lily  
good. Yeah, absolutely. And do you think like, you're seeing like, in your first company, did you see more like frustration? Did you see more tantrums because of that?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, definitely. And there was definitely to like some people that I feel like can get like this, like laser focus on, Oh, I gotta get my trials, I gotta get all these trials, I have to hit this goal of this many trials an hour. And I think that took a lot away from the other things that like, like the playing, you could have been doing because if you're just, you know, hammering, and all these trials, they're gonna have a behavior at some point, because nobody wants to be told, Do this 20 times in a row. And so there was some issues with that. And I feel like here at my new company, they were like, We will, we will tell you guys, if you're not getting enough trials, like we'll talk about it. But so far, everyone's doing great. Our sessions are like, three hours and 45 minutes to four hours. Like, for with one kid, so you have time to like, get enough trials no matter what and play and even deal with like the behavior or stuff like that. So they even blocked it out dev enough, because that was like at my last company, if I only had an hour session. And I had to do the way that they tracked it you had to do to like discrete trial teaching sessions. And then one like, naturalistic environment, like page of things. And so you had to get those in, or you couldn't stop your session. And so if I only had an hour, a majority of that hour was running lessons. So I would be able to stop my session. And so then those kids that go to somebody after me are probably burnt out on all everything I had to run to finish my session. And so here, my company now if they just, they just allow enough time for like anything to happen in a session and you get enough stuff. So you don't have to sit there worried if you're getting enough trials, because you probably always will, with the amount of time you'd have.

Lily  
Yeah, I mean, my initial reaction was like, four hours can be kind of a lot for the child, but it sounds like it's almost like more effective than this time.

Speaker 2  
I agree. Yeah. Cuz when I was first looking at my new schedule, when I switched jobs, I was like, oh, man, those are long set up. But then once you're in it, you can like you could literally play for an hour if you want it in the beginning. Or if you have to do like a wait out. If there's like a behavior, and you just have to wait, that's something I love to, they're really big on just waiting, because it's like, the client is clearly not ready. And you can't make them be ready. So you, you can just wait. And they're really, I just love it because they care about like the client's best interest. And they're like, what's going to be the best for them? Because even if you have to wait like a whole four hour session, and they like, can't or they're not able to move on from it, then that's okay, too. And you didn't get any trials. That's okay. Because they were having a behavior and, and stuff like that. So it wasn't like you ever had to try and like speed through a behavior to fix it. So you could get your stuff.

Lily  
Okay, yeah. And I was curious, like, you mentioned, like, burnout in the children like is that do you see that either company like, and what the difference in love burnout might look like, between each company?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, I and I feel like for all the clients, like they have ABA, they have speech, they have school, they have preschool and daycare, they have ot like, and all of these things in their day, like they have a full time schedule, and they're like, four years old. And, and I think that's what's so special about ABA is that it's supposed to be taught through play, because ABA is also like intensive therapy. And then and so that's a lot that they're going to be asked of and doing. But they also need to have fun because and like OT is also a good place that you can have fun, but you also have to do work. And then like speech and or sometimes feeding therapy, and so they have all this stuff. And so I feel like it's very easy. I feel like it's very easy for them to get burnt out. And so that's why I think the playing and building that like rapport each time is so important and like providing like the therapy or the lessons and like a fun way. And then sometimes do they just come in, they're just tired, and they'll like fall asleep during session or they're just really emotional, or they have a behavior coming inside because they don't want to be here and stuff like that.

Lily  
Yeah. And what do you do when like, the child doesn't want to be there?

Speaker 2  
That's where we kind of turn more to like, okay, how can we make it fun and make it. So like they do want to be here. And so that's where we would kind of like, let up a little bit on like, what we were planning to run that day, maybe just run like maintenance stuff so that it's easy for them and they know it and they'll get it right. And so then they could just get more reinforcement. There's also like behavior momentum, where it's kind of like you run a quite a few easy things, and then you run a hard trial, and then they get like, mega reinforcement, because it was like a build up. Yeah. Yeah. But most of the time, you would start out just like playing or asking them, like, what do you want to do? And like, maybe they can watch a video first, or something like that, just to kind of start it off on the right foot?

Lily  
Yeah. So it sounds like positive reinforcement plays a really big role. Yes, yeah. Is that kind of like, the main? Like, yeah,

Speaker 2  
like what they say like ABA, they say, like positive reinforcement increases the behavior? And then like, yeah,

Lily  
do you ever, like, have to use? I don't, I guess the opposite of like, reinforcement is like, versus

Speaker 2  
they. It's not necessarily like, like how they use punishment. In like AB terms. It's more like, because there's like, positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment and negative punishment. And the positive and negative kind of mean, like adding something or removing something. And so like, negative reinforcement would be like, Oh, you did what I wanted you to do, but I still took your toys away. And so then they wouldn't probably do that, again, because I took the toy. And so like, or how negative reinforcement can accidentally come up is if I, like had a kid do a trial, and I was marking my data, instead of giving them their reinforcement right away, that would be negatively reinforcing. Because if they did what I wanted, but I'm still withholding the reinforcement, because I got distracted putting in my data instead of giving them the toy right away.

Lily  
Interesting. Okay. And sorry, well, I'm

Speaker 2  
just gonna say so it's really rare. Usually, we would always do positive reinforcement, the only time like, we would be taking away stuff from the kids would be like, or like, changing the environment would be probably for safety concerns during a behavior. And then I was gonna I think once or sometimes if they have an attention based behaviors that we're trying to break. So like, there's a thing like planned ignoring, where it's like, they're doing something for attention, and you can like, see them out of the corner of your eye, but you're not going to look at them and give them that attention.

Lily  
Yeah. Do you mind providing, like an example of when you use that?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, um, one, oh, we had one client that would very lightly engage in head banging on the wall. And so we would have an exterior person come in and block it. And because he was, had been for you to react, just that his therapist. And so you'd have one that like, the BCBA, wouldn't be blocking it, but also ignoring and then we would start like playing with something else or talking about something. And then so he was safe the whole time. But then once he was interested in whatever you were doing, he would come over and say your name, and then you could give him attention. Or you could like sit there and like model like tapping and then they'll tap you and then you can give him attention. But it's just a break that because it's not functional to, you know, hit your head and then get all this attention.

Lily  
Yeah, absolutely. And so like, when in those situations, like what is the child's reaction to ignoring is does it ever elicit like a bad reaction?

Speaker 2  
If it weren't you, then the BSB would change the plan, and we wouldn't have to do plan to ignore it anymore. So most of the time, it is like a positive thing. And since they are like, since I was just with like early intervention kit, sometimes they don't understand that you're purposely not hearing them. I think sometimes they're more like what's happening like, Hello, yeah. And then so then when they come over, and then you're allowed to prompt them, like, you could be like, see my name, like, like, What's my name? And then they'll like respond. Or sometimes you when we're teaching kids just like how to tap, we won't respond until they tap us. And so then they'll be like, there'll be like, hello, hello. Like they sometimes they don't initially understand that we're purposely not paying attention. Yeah. Yeah.

Lily  
And I'm curious like some other behaviors you might work on. Like, it sounds like you work on safety, but like, what are some other behaviors you work on with children?

Speaker 2  
We definitely work on, like, the whole goal of it is just to like, what's the most like functional way that like, so like a big one, like one of the lessons we have is like sometimes teaching them how to wave. Because like when you think about when they start kindergarten, like if the if they're like, Okay, like Simon Says wave, like, all the other kids probably would, you know, be able to do it. So you want to make sure like they have these certain goals. I know a lot of it is the BCBAs can sit in on the IEP meetings through the school. And so sometimes they'll talk about certain things that maybe they're not hitting in the classroom, or like they need help like staying in their chair. So we like can work on like, sit in your chair for like five minutes, like or starts, like 30 seconds, and then like builds up. And so it's kind of a lot of like, we do you like fine motor, gross motor coix, like their language or certain sounds like tagging labeling things, and stuff like that. So it's kind of more so like it tailored uniquely to them and what they need. And then whatever behaviors that they have. We they have like behavior intervention plans for all of them in case they do come up. I had one client that had like a disrobing behavior, but it never came up. So we never had to work on it. Okay, or as far as right now, it hasn't come up. Yeah. But they're all in there just in case. And then what's hard about in Bend specifically, they do not allow, I don't know the reason why, but they don't allow the ABA therapists to go into the classrooms with the clients. And, and that's where I feel like sometimes they need the most support is like, they'll be great at our clinic, or they'll be great in a home session or great out in public and offset, but then their issues just solely revolve around school. And so we can like, try and help. But if we're not there, we we can't do much. So we could do similar lessons, like, Oh, we're gonna work on sitting our chair at the clinic, but we can't necessarily do that in a classroom. And they do great at the clinic. So they're gonna master it, but then they go to school, and they can't transfer it sometimes.

Lily  
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, something I've like we've been curious about is like whether or not children understand the purpose of the behaviors they're learning, because like, sometimes they just only perform them in really specific circumstances to a point, because it sounds like that might be the case. Do you see that kind of often?

Speaker 2  
I think with sometimes some of the that's a good point. This is this is solely my opinion. But I think sometimes with the older kids, I don't, I think that that's a little bit harder, because they do have like generalization. So they, you have a lesson in intervention, then you master it. So it's in maintenance. And then ideally, the next step is generalization. So they can take it to all areas of their life. And sometimes the maintenance a generalization generalization, generalization is hard, because we can't practice it in multiple settings. And that's what's so important is that you could at least practice it in two different types of settings. So then hopefully, they'll get it in the third setting. Yeah, but that one's one of the hardest ones to get. Sometimes, like, it's easy to teach them like, Oh, that's a dog. And this breeds also a dog. And this is also a dog. And then if there's a part, that's easy, because Oh, that's a dog. But then if they're in an environment, where they're not necessarily like, happy to be in, like sometimes school for these kids, if that's where they're really struggling, they're not gonna be ready, I guess for that generalization. Because something there is adversive.

Lily  
Yeah. And so do you wish you could ever, like, provide work outside the clinic or like outside the home? Yes,

Speaker 2  
I would love that we do have at my current company, you just have to sign like waivers for it. We're allowed to go out into the community with them if there's like a planned thing, like, we have like a little museum in town, and like we're allowed to, like go on like a day, like to the museum with certain clients if it's scheduled. But the only issue is, since we're billing insurance, it has to be an environment that we can run lessons in. And so like for going in the museum, you can run all of their safety lessons, and that's enough for a session. But like in school, since they have to be doing school, sometimes it's hard for like, that environment. And I almost wonder if that's why sometimes they don't want to send is because we can distract from the overall class to focus on something. Yeah.

Lily  
Yeah, but it sounds like it could be like helpful. cuz I can be overwhelming to be in such like, a classroom.

Speaker 2  
I agree. And I it's hard to because the like school is not trained and like dealing with those types of behaviors like like the one kid I mentioned earlier with like the disrobing like, he would get upset at school and just throw up at school. And their only option was to take him to a room and close the door and put something over the window. So because he couldn't be naked around everybody, and it's like, yeah, that's right. And then they'd have to call his mom and his mom would have to come get him. And so then that's totally reinforcing his behavior. Because if he's like, anytime I disrobe at school, I get to go home. Yeah, and so that's where we always try to not reinforce certain behaviors that we're trying to break, but sometimes a situation like that. They they're not like legally allowed to go in and help him get dressed because he's naked. So a parent has to come.

Lily  
Yeah, yeah, that's interesting. Yeah. And so like, I mean, how do you it's but you said, like, he doesn't really do that at the clinic. So yeah,

Speaker 2  
he was working. Yeah, so we can work on and I guess it hasn't been happening. I think it happened, like once or twice at the start of the school year. So I think he was able to stop it. But they had also recently moved from like, a different state or something. And I guess that that wherever they lived prior that it was really bad at that school. So then they were thinking, Oh, maybe it was something at the school would like, trigger him or like, become so aversive. That's what he would go to. And then I think it's only happened twice. So hot, because he hasn't, it hasn't been a brought up issue consistently. I think it was just near the start of the school because he used to have a plan for it. Like he said, like occurred at the clinic, but then it never did. So got put on hold. Okay,

Lily  
yeah. Yeah. And I'm curious, like, you said, you don't really, like, that kind of stuff just really happened with the company you work with, but like, do you see a lot of like, tantrums or frustration?

Speaker 2  
Like, I want to say like, yes, and no, almost because I feel like I would say like, yes, but not necessarily in like a bad way. It's because it is like behavioral therapy. Like, that's our whole goal. So it's technically good for us to see the behaviors, if they're happening so that we can like, try, like, work through the BIP and like, see if that's actually a positive thing that helps. And if, if it does work, then that's great. Like I had, I have one client that's very shy. And so sometimes, like, asking a demand is like, too much, and she'll just like start crying. And yes, but her PIP is if that happens, it's kind of like that, like minimal attention to the crying. And then like find something to redirect it or something that she's like interested in playing with. And or it was over potty training, that was the big one. Anytime the timer went off for potty training, she would get upset. And so we had to figure out a way to like, what can make it so fun that you're excited to go in there. But also not like the the escape essentially, just because you're crying like you don't have to go potty. So we wait until she was done crying. And we were able to like successfully redirect her to something she wanted. And then say like, Okay, now it's time to go sit on the potty. And then she would have the item and then she would go. So then we started doing like, oh, what item do you want to take potty with you? And then she would pick it and then she would just go. And so it was like helpful to see like to work through that like, okay, she just she needs something to comfort her while she's in there because she doesn't necessarily like it. And so that was like, able to figure that out by not just being like, Oh, you're crying? Come here. Let me hug you. Yeah. And so I feel like sometimes that part is hard when they're like, just like visually upset because it's like natural to be like, Do you need a heart? Yeah. And so I would say like, fairly like in the beginning for sure. Especially like when you're starting a new lesson or they're like starting like ABA in general, I feel like the behaviors are very, very common. But then once they've been there for and it's intense therapy, so sometimes even like just like up to three months like they're already like making like great changes and things and like just growing. And so there's some kids that like I've had for like a month and I didn't see any behavior like the whole month they never had a behavior with me. And that's that's great. Like that's what we're working towards, but they still have Other like goals that they still need to hit that may be like their behaviors are dropping, but they still need to work on. Like being able to wave or being able to do certain, like motor imitations or stuff like that.

Lily  
Yeah. And have you ever seen like other RBT struggle with this like, trying to like, it sounds like you have a pretty good hang of like dealing with behaviors like that. But what about other RBTs?

Speaker 2  
Yeah, I think so. Especially because I also feel like I'm a little bit lucky, because a lot of my kids have like low intensity behaviors, but there's a few that have like the high energy and then like, the high behaviors, and they, they power through it like really, really well. But then sometimes, like after the fact, they'll be like I was so like, stressed out the whole time, or I didn't think that that was like, great. And what's nice is all of our BCBAs. If there's if they ever hear a behavior, they'll still like come over. But they'll usually come over where like, the client cannot see them. Because the BCBAs have a lot of like, instructional control, because they're and or at least like, or sometimes the clients like prefer the BCBAs over us, because when the BCBAs come in, they usually play or probe a few things. And then like head out. Yeah. And so like, they'll usually come and try and check in and be like, Oh, do you need me think you have it? Do you want? Like, can I grab you anything? And so it's nice, because they're always there in case there's something like, too big happening. Or if you feel like a little bit uncomfortable, or if you just want some extra support. Like they're really good about being there. And I love it too, because they're not like, it never feels like we are to ask for help. Which is nice.

Lily  
Yeah, that's really good. I do want to just like acknowledge the time I'm like, I'm curious. Do you have like, a few extra minutes to answer? Oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  
totally fine. Yeah.

Lily  
No, I'm just like, really enjoying this conversation? It's really nice to hear, like, your opinion on everything. Thank you. So yeah, I'm also curious, like, it sounds like be CPAs kind of handle a lot. Do they also handle like parents? Or have you ever? Like, do you talk to parents,

Speaker 2  
I only would speak to parents, if I'm like picking up the kid like to start their day. And they're like, dropping the kid off. Or at the end of the day, if I'm like taking them back to mom and dad, also in the homes like, a lot of the time because a parent has to be in the home for us to be there. So yeah, like a lot of the times like, talk a little bit. But mostly, we're always told to just like refer them back to the BCBA of their case. And so like any parent trainings, the BCBA does any like, meetings through the school that BCBA goes to with them. It's mostly like, that's their point of contact. Sometimes, like we'll talk, or like I had one of the kids that I have, I've been with him since his like first day. And so I've just been with him for so long. And we've had like a little bit of a turnover with his BCBA in particular. And so it was nice, because I got to kind of help fill in the newest BCBA like, Oh, this is what happened. Or she'd be like, Why is this in his program like this? And I'll be like, I think it was the very first one, I don't think it's relevant. And stuff like that. And so that's what I love. Like when I said earlier that they like really value our opinion, is because they recognize like, Oh, you're you see this kid, you know, like, twice a week, all the time. And so the BCBA is definitely talked to the parents most and that's the important contact we that's kind of nice, because it's not as stressful for us. So if there's anything that we don't know the answer to, or if they're asking about like a turnover question or staff issue or something, we can just say like, Oh, if you contact your BCBA they can help you with?

Lily  
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna ask if you like, like, wish you could speak more to the parents, but it sounds like it's kind of

Speaker 2  
certain ones I definitely do. Especially like my one my one client that I started with, I really, like, just have a lot of interest in like talking to her about like her kid and stuff like that, but it's never like it's not like you're not allowed to it's just a lot safer if you just refer to the BCBA because, like, there's certain questions that we wouldn't know. Okay, all right answers we wouldn't know. Yeah.

Lily  
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, and then I'm just gonna move on to like the final set of questions. So in doing some research, like my team, came across some controversies about ABA, and we were curious like, if you've heard of these and if so from where?

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, like froze for a second. Oh my god.

Lily  
I've been having some issues. Um, But yeah, so like, Have you ever heard of any, like controversies? And if so from where?

Speaker 2  
Like, the biggest one that I've heard is the one people try and say that like ABA is abusive I, I recognize that probably in the or in the past. It was not handled the right way. But I genuinely like. And that's funny is I didn't even know that people thought that until after I was working in the field. But I, so I agree I ABA was abusive in the past. I feel like it is very progressive now. And I think that it is a very valuable, like, avenue of services for people that are interested in it. Yeah. And that's like, the main controversy I've heard. So I don't know if there's others.

Lily  
Yeah. And do you think like that? Like there are any RBTs out there? Or like, Have you heard of anything that, like you think isn't really like as progressive, as progressive, as you would want ABA? To see Sorry? Like, have you like seen or heard anything where you think like, that's not what you want ABA to like, see

Speaker 2  
that. But what I mentioned earlier, they're like, Oh, you have to do this before we move on. And like you're kind of stopped. I don't think that that's like an appropriate method to like, teach somebody something because then you're, I think that that's forceful, because it's like, okay, you you're you better do it, or we're just gonna be here all day, and you're gonna be upset every time you look at that one piece of toy that's not in the box. I think that they're like that, certain things like that. Because I feel like when you look at it, you have to be like, Okay, is it really that big of a deal if they don't put one toy into that box? And so I think sometimes it's easy to get hung up on certain things of a lesson or certain ways that it's done. And so I think that's why the supervision is so important. Because then they can say, like, no, it's really not a big deal or okay, I'm seeing that they're really struggling with pickup, maybe we can try this next time. And so I definitely think if the RBTs aren't getting correct supervision, I think there's definitely room for it to not be like progressive anymore.

Lily  
Yeah, but it sounds like the company you work with does a really good job.

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, it's such a good company.

Lily  
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I'm, like, really happy to hear that. Because like, you don't always I know, like, I've heard a lot about like, improper supervision and all that. So it's like, refreshing to hear.

Speaker 2  
And I think that's what's hard, too, is because the BCBAs have to do so much that like this, sometimes the supervision is easy to, like, sometimes miss. But my company that's like in the BCBS contract, like, if they're not hitting their correct supervision, like they, they can get in trouble for that. And so I feel like it's not that any of them had a hard time with it to begin with, I just think it was smart to kind of set it up that way. And they also have, because they have to do their big reports at the end are like, we have to submit them to insurance, their authorization so that they can keep getting services, that our company has the deadline a month earlier than it actually is. So in case any of them are running behind on that they do have a little bit of leeway to still get it done. And because it's AI, they have so much to do they have to do like their supervision, their authorizations for all of their clients and RPCVs have like 13 to, to like 20 clients each. Oh, wow. Yeah. And thankfully, we just got a new one. So that'll like break up a little bit. But for the time being that was so much on their plate, yet they were still hitting their supervision. And so that, that was great for us, and like the whole team, but that was probably so much for them. That that's also like a hard thing, too, is they do have so much going on.

Lily  
Yeah, I can admit it sounds like there's just burnout for everyone. Like there's just a lack of resources.

Speaker 2  
Yeah, and that's the hard thing is because it's great what they do, but it's just like, how can you change it so that it's a little bit more effective and better for everybody? But it's almost hard to because it does essentially work the way that it's going. But that burnout rate is so large.

Lily  
Yeah. And then I guess like that's sort of like a criticism would be like the burnout, but would you have any other like criticisms about ABA? Um, I would just

Speaker 2  
like kind of like the training aspect of it like I think it would be a I don't know how what happened but it would be really cool if like the BAC B had like a bit A like training thing that like, Okay, anybody getting into ABA like, this is what you need to do this is the exam. And that's it like or something or even if it's not an exam just like a discussion or a talk about it just so you understand that people at least have the basis before they start. Because I think that can also lead to like confusion, being a little bit like insecure and like what you're doing, not very confident. And then I think sometimes that can also lead to burnout, because you're like, I'm going to work and I'm not sure of anything that I'm doing. And that's hard.

Lily  
Yeah. Yeah, I totally agree. I think like, a lot could be solved in the field if there was just a little more training or like,

Unknown Speaker  
Yeah, I agree.

Lily  
Yeah. So that's, like, all the questions I have. Is there anything else like you want to talk about that we didn't cover?

Unknown Speaker  
I think I'm good. And thank you so much for your time. I'm sorry, we I ran you over a little?

Lily  
Okay. Like, I really appreciate you staying a little extra. I do just have to ask like two quick questions. Yeah. I want to ask if you're comfortable with my team sharing an anonymized transcript of today's interview with interested parties, like, for example, researchers at our institution. Yeah, of course, and like your name and like your face is not attach to anything. Okay. And like, what about the audio recording? Would you be happy for us to share that too? Yeah, that's totally fine. Okay, perfect. Yeah, and if you have any lasting like, comments, questions or concerns, please feel free to email me. But thank you so much. No, thank you. This was like an awesome conversation, and I really appreciate it.

Speaker 2  
Thank you. I really appreciate you guys. I was so excited when I got the email. I was like, Oh, that's cool.

Lily  
Yeah, I feel like RBTs don't really, they don't really ever have the platform to speak about their experiences. So it's nice to finally hear about it.

Speaker 2  
I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Really? Yeah, have a great day. Bye. Bye.
