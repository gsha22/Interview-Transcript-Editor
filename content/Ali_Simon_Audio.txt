Simon Cullen
They're all right. So just to confirm, are you happy for me to record this interview today? Yes. Wonderful. So I'm just going to start off with some background questions before we get into the sort of deep stuff. So, in what state are you currently working? I work in Illinois. Okay. I haven't been but I know the Soufiane Stevens albums was oh, that was an old album. It was a good one. So what is the highest level of education you've reached so far?

Unknown Speaker
Um, I have a master's degree in child and developmental psychology. And I'm just about finished with my postmasters certificate in ABA. Awesome.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so how many years have you been working with clients?

Unknown Speaker
Um, in ABA specifically, I've been doing it for about a year and a half. Um, I've done a lot of other client facing work. And then I also worked in direct support care for about a year as well.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so I'll, I'll put down 1.5 for APA and let's, let's say another two years or so, working with and that's with, like, developmentally delayed kids,

Unknown Speaker
correct? Yep.

Simon Cullen
Okay, and what settings do you deliver ABA therapy and homes, clinic school,

Unknown Speaker
typically clinic, but a small portion of in home.

Simon Cullen
Okay, and what credentials do you hold from the BAC B,

Unknown Speaker
I have an RBT credential, and I'm registered in their system because I'm completing my supervised field work towards my behavior analyst certification, but I do not have that

Simon Cullen
yet. With my next question is do you plan to become a B CPA? So I will say yes, you do. All right. So one thing that this research project has turned up are a number of concerns with the way BTS are treated and paid. So if you don't mind my asking, What was your starting salary in your very first position as an RBT?

Unknown Speaker
Yep. Um, so I started off as a BT. Even though I had my master's degree, I hadn't worked in the field. So I got paid $17 an hour. Okay. was pretty brutal.

Simon Cullen
No, it sounds brutal. The next question might make it even more brutal. Did you receive health insurance?

Unknown Speaker
I did. Luckily, I was offered full time. But the majority of people hired by my company are offered part time, so they do not receive health insurance.

Simon Cullen
So I'll say yes, but only for a minority. Yeah. Full time as all right, and what is your current salary?

Unknown Speaker
My current salary is 55k. But I work as a case manager supervising six clients. Wow. That sounds like a pretty big caseload. Um, I mean, it's like, it's tough, because in reality, it's not. But given my journey thus far, and how much the BCBAs that work at my job are not managing. Just like your what's wrong with this.

Simon Cullen
I'm gonna want to hear more about that. So hours a week do work in title with, like, considering all the clients that you see, um,

Unknown Speaker
it fluctuates a lot right now, over the past couple months, it's been over 50 hours a week. I'm supposed to be a target at 40. But I feel like 40 is not enough to deal with everything. So it's kind of like, there are plenty of people who worked 40 or less. And those are the people who aren't fulfilling their jobs with integrity. So yeah.

Simon Cullen
You want to talk more about what what you're doing and those additional hours and that you're working after the 14

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, so, um, I feel like if I just had to work on the case management part of things, which is like the billables for BCBAs. Um, that would be very manageable because our company requires us to have at least 10% supervision of our caseload hours. So if my kids there 30 hours a week, I have to at minimum be in session with him and his staff members for for 10% of those hours, so it'd be three hours. And depending on the health insurance, it can go up to like 20. So that's like, keeps me pretty busy with six kiddos, but still gives me time in between to like, eat lunch, take a break, you know, work on some paperwork at my desk. But with all of the staffing crises, which I'm sure you're hearing from everywhere, there is a significant lack of coverage and a lack of clinical support, just basic support for like bathroom breaks. And that is something where I take our Code of Ethics very seriously. And on that note, it's the old code of ethics that said, you can't disparage ABA because I was like, red flag. I'm not abiding by this, because that's absurd. So that is old, it's no longer in effect.

Simon Cullen
That's good news. Okay.

Unknown Speaker
But okay, yeah, it's things like that, where I could choose to go home, or I could choose to support my staff, which, like, I know, probably won't be supported if I go home, because other people are far too comfortable going, like, not my problem, someone else's problem. And I'm like, these people can't get pardon my French a fucking bathroom break. This is not ethical. Like, if you're asking me to not do it. That's not a solution to my concerns. Because like, then you're all sitting around so comfortably. While someone cannot use the restroom for hours on it. Like that is not okay. In any in any way. So, you want to talk about unethical behavior? Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Wow. I have heard. Not only that, I've also heard people not getting breaks to eat. Yes. Yeah. I guess I am gonna want to ask you some sort of bigger reflective questions. Let me just have a look what I've got immediately on this page, and then see if I want to just, yeah, pause. So I have definitely heard, like you predicted that there is some sort of crisis, it appears. Now having spoken with, my team has interviewed around over 100 RBTs. Now who've probably reflected collectively on three or 400 clinics. And it's almost universal. I think, on one hand, the number of RBTs who have said to me. Yeah, we don't have a concerning level of turnover. Yeah, I can count. I think on one hand, also, the number who have told me, I was my training was adequate to prepare me for the first day on the job. I think it might be one hand that I've had people who, who said that? Yeah. I've, we also have a whole section on supervision. Are you satisfied with the quality of supervision that you ever say? Do you feel supported? Again, it may, that may be two hands, but actually, if we two hands if it's like, Have you ever worked at any clinic where you are happy? Because often what happens is, they'll tell me? Oh, yeah, my current clinic is wonderful. The reason I'm there, though, is because I quit all of these other jobs until I got there. Yeah, I really. I am really curious, I guess about two things. One is your thoughts on what kind of bigger structural issues might be at play here, because there's, this is a commonality that I've seen so much now it's not it's not coincidental? And then I guess I'm also interested in maybe we'll hit that question next. But, you know, if you're the dictator, the new dictator of ABA, you can change it in any way you want. What would you do? So let's start. Let's start with the first question, though. What do you have thoughts on sort of what are the systemic things that are going on here?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. So I have a lot of thoughts.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, great. I'm really glad to hear it, please. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker
Is this you know, where am I going to fit in once I get my credential? And is that with an ABA clinic, given what I've seen, and what I've heard? So I think there are a number of structural issues. I think one of the biggest ones is funding in my state. My supervisor is the privacy and compliance officer for our company. So she is extremely knowledgeable about like, all of the red tape. And she has told me which like, I haven't verified myself, but I'm assuming she's not lying that our compensation for services through insurance companies has not gone up in almost A decade. So you think about the inflation, especially in Illinois, we're in the Chicagoland area. So it's expensive. And yet, we are paying people close to minimum wage. And it's not an easy job. So it's like I could go work my butt off and do extremely emotionally and physically laborious work day to day for less money than I could working at a Starbucks down the road. So you very much have a compensation issue, which I think you see in direct support, care, anything that's insurance funded, unfortunately, because a lot of insurance companies are increasing their standards for quality of care, quote, unquote, but what they're really doing is making it harder and harder for companies to get paid, even when they do provide the services. And therefore you have companies going out of business, they can't afford to pay people they can't afford, like the current situation, we have people who get paid $15 an hour if their client cancels, and clients are canceling constantly their children too. So it's like they get sick things happen, people are late, and that cripples people financially. But you also have like, you can't staff all these extra breaks and pay people because there's not enough extra money floating around. And then too, I've heard that there's a lot of private equity companies taking over, which I know I used to work in the promotional products industry and private equity takes over and runs things into the ground from like a human resources standpoint. And so it's really bad that private equity firms are taking over ABA companies as like a different form of diverse revenue stream, because that is not a functional way to look at these businesses. And unfortunately, too, I think that case cascades down into very poor leadership structures where too many people are pulled in too many different directions that they can't actually manage. And there is a very strong need for strong management. So that people can be trained well, so that they can be supported and supervised appropriately. And even in my company, I we do a lot better. From what I've heard with like, keeping up with the standards to which the BAC be expects, credentialed individuals to, whereas like, I've heard there plenty of ABA companies that like people never see their supervisor, whereas my company is almost the opposite, where you see your supervisor all the time, and they will micromanage you to death. So it's like, I think you have these extremes where either you never see someone or when you do see them, they are just obsessive. They have very little leadership or management experience. They micromanage every aspect of what their therapists are doing, instead of focusing on like, what are the things we need to be worried about from a treatment integrity standpoint versus going like? Well, the way that you said that one word in this three hour session is no, no, no, no, no. And it's like, Dude, you got to like, you have to give people some breathing room, while still providing that ethical and supportive supervision. So there's all of that, um, and then I think to like, just in general, it's very difficult to make it through this field. Because support services are so underfunded, and because it's so emotionally intensive. But you also have a lot of people who, even though I had a master's degree, I was getting paid the same amount as a kid who just graduated high school. So it's like, it's very hard to be well educated and work in this field. So you have people who just don't have the education or training and they're trying their best but like, there's just not enough time or resources to help them along. And then what else? I feel like that's a big part of it. Um, and then also, I just think in general, from what I've heard, a lot of people who come to ABA or have been in ABA for whatever reason, have these really bizarre blind spots where like, they're not being self aware, they are not practicing what they preach. I've like looked at other podcasts and research on the topic too, which is exactly what it was like, I need to participate in this. Because it's just bizarre, we talk about positive reinforcement, and it's like, we practice the complete opposite. We like are this obsessive compliance based structure of leadership? And I'm just like, No, that's not how any of this works. And if you're a board certified behavior analyst, you should know better, like it's your ethical obligation to know better and do better. But unfortunately, I think that comes down to like the psychological component of these kinds of trauma bonded workplaces, where, like in nursing care, you see people who go, Well, my job stressful, so I'm going to excuse XYZ behavior that's not appropriate in the workplace. And that's not ethical. But we're trying to get by, because that's the thing is, everyone's talking about how other ABA companies are going out of business, but we're staying afloat. And it's like, well, that doesn't excuse unethical business practices, and unethical, you know, professional activities. If we have to compromise that much is too much at some point. So yeah, there's, there's a lot of things working against people. And unfortunately, I feel like if you are the type of person who will stand up and say like, Hey, excuse me, this doesn't seem right. People are just like, No, you don't understand. And you try to get forced out with the rest of the turnover. Oh, yeah.

Simon Cullen
I've heard from numerous RBTs being written up as unprofessional. Exactly. Yeah, that is always the word. Professional, and I'm like, Well, what, what did you do? Oh, I suggested that, you know, the client was not benefiting from this particular thing. And I thought we should maybe give them more time between trials, or I thought I have one say, I didn't want to do the stimming. I had like, some targets for stinky stimming behaviors like to reduce or whatever, full extinction or what but I had an RBT who herself and she revealed later on in the interview had been diagnosed as autistic herself when she was four years old. And she went to the manager, the clinic was like, I just can't do that. You don't understand what stimming is for you don't understand? Yes. And I'm like listening to this. Yeah, they threatened to fire her. If she didn't, yes. They wanted this girl two years old to say the words during a trip like to transition from one activity to the next. They wanted the kid to produce the words all done between activities, right. And she said to me, like, the saddest thing about it was like the people who the BCBA wouldn't work with the kid enough, so they couldn't really understand the kids speech. Because that apparently, you you really need to work with this kids to get understand how they speak. And they would physically restrain this kid in a chair until she said, All done. And this is like I went to management and complained about this. And they threatened to fire me. I'm like, What is going on? So you just said a lot of stuff that I kind of want to go back and unpack a little bit? Sure. So you said that there was a big problem with poor leadership, and that definitely resonates with a lot of things I've heard. And you said that the poor leadership was not focused on what mattered, which was treatment integrity. I think that was your phrase. Yes. Can you unpack that a little bit for me? What? Like, maybe you can give me some examples on something. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. So I mean, kind of what you've been saying was exactly my experience. And honestly, I am not autistic, but I'm technically in the neuro divergence fear. Just because of a pretty intense like trauma history throughout my childhood and so similar to the RBT, who was like, Hey, you don't understand what stimming is for and that's okay. But like, I cannot go through this, I had to witness a lot of what I would say is unethical treatment of these poor freakin children by BCBAs, who had no clue. And you know, they wanted to come at me about like, well, it's not developmentally appropriate. And I'm like, I have a master's degree in child and developmental psychology. And it's pretty recent. So do you really want to talk to me about what's developmentally appropriate? Or do you just want to harass me? So I did experience a lot of bullying and harassment, with people trying to weaponize their authority against me for stating very professionally and politely, my personal and professional, you know, qualms? I guess, like if I'm going, Hey, this is concerning. And I, you know, I'm not an expert. So can you help me understand this? And it's just like, well, he doesn't, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, That's not, that's not an evidence based reason. This is, you know, you guys talk about mentalistic attributions, and yet the scientific contributions of both behavioral science and neuro psychology, which is not pie in the sky, Freudian things, these are like brain scans are going against everything you're saying. So like, I don't understand why I should be listening to you. And going through with something that's not ethical, that doesn't align with research that doesn't align with other professionals who have more expertise, such as like speech language pathologist, when using communication devices, things like that. And you the same thing, leadership goes, well, you need to listen to what your BCBA says, Because you are under the clinical branch of leadership. So if an SLP tells you one thing, you are not to listen to them, because you work under your BCBA. So I think there is this like, bizarre sense of like, authoritarian mindset that stems from this kind of like fear based code of ethics and treatment integrity, and it's like, I get that. But when you yourself are the one committing the violations. And by the way, the reporting process to the BAC B is it's like superfluous, so there's no one who you can truly go to and say, like, this is wrong, and I've documented it, and I've tried through every step of my organization, no one will help. You know, what do you do? Like you literally just have a choice to leave or not. And that's honestly how a lot of the leadership team thinks, you know, when I bring up issues, even to my supervisor, who's the head of privacy, compliance, all of the things she goes like, well, that's not technically an ethical violation, that's more of a moral issue. And there's difference and I'm like, Okay, well, it was like, technically, that's true. But objectively speaking, not allowing adults to have bathroom breaks, is unethical. And I'm pretty sure it violates the ethics code, our company values, and probably some employment laws. So it's like, things like that, where people they have this like, cognitive dissonance and their way of like preserving themselves and going like, this is how you survive in this field is compromising a lot of things for the people around them. And I feel like a lot of people unfortunately came up in the field when it was still emerging, and they were taught compliance training, and they were taught this stupid, old code of ethics. That was absurd, and was like, you cannot disparage ABA period. And it's like, that's not, that's not okay. You know, and so it's not really their fault, but it's also just a problem. And the BAC B has made it very hard for people like me to get credentialed in response to the poor quality of BCBAs, who already exists in the fields and unfortunately, from what I'm seeing, it's not helping Yeah, solve that problem.

Simon Cullen
Explain a little more there for me. So the the BAC B's making it hard. What do you mean by that?

Unknown Speaker
So the bseb has changed and is constantly shifting their requirements for what you have to do to become a board certified behavior analyst. And technically, you can be a behavior analyst and not have that certification. So that's its own thing. But let's say I have a co worker. So a BCBA, who I certainly believe should not be allowed to practice anymore because she has for retic. She had, I think, a psychology degree in her bachelor's program. And then she took a two year online program that is terrible. I know for a fact because lots of the people that I've worked with who graduated from that program know, next to nothing, which is

Simon Cullen
stalking, you know what it's called the name of the online program, Ball State

Unknown Speaker
University.

Simon Cullen
Both old state of Ball State,

Unknown Speaker
Ball State be a ll.

Simon Cullen
And it's a BCBA training or ABA.

Unknown Speaker
So it's a master's degree in ABA. And from what I was told, it's only like 20 grand for the whole master's program, and you can cheat and you can slack off quite a bit. So they haven't changed that. But the BAC B is tightening up like what kind of degrees can you have, in I believe, the next 10 years, you will not be able to take the path that I'm taking the certification where like I have the Master's in child and developmental psychology. But I'm doing the coursework for the postmasters certificate. And I feel like that's an issue because I know BCBAs, who have had just an ABA master's, and I know BCBAs, who have gotten education degrees, and then become certified. And both of them I feel like are very seriously missing the education piece of child and developmental psychology because everyone's constantly talking about what's developmentally appropriate. And they're comparing that to how children are treated in school systems, which, quite honestly, there are a lot of issues with that, in my opinion. So there's this just total gap in people's understanding, and if you're dealing with children, and you're impacting their developmental trajectory, and yet, you have no real idea about what is and is not developmentally appropriate, especially for a neuro diverse population and very vulnerable population, you should not be a BCBA. So all that aside, they also doubled the supervision requirements. So I have to obtain 2000 supervised fieldwork hours, and they're extremely specific in what they can and cannot be. However, there are many people who will lie their way through it, and not really do the work. And

Simon Cullen
they have someone like, wouldn't the supervisor also need to lie to say that they did supervise?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. And that's something that we're coming up against where my we just found out that Blue Cross Blue Shield may pay interns such as myself or case managers for their protocol modification, which is like a supervision. And almost no one in the company who's been practicing with some level of autonomy has billable services that they can, like, prove we're billable. So it's like you basically have people practicing and getting passed along and the BCBS go like, like this is never going to come back on me like I don't care. And that's, yeah, so I guess accountability becomes a huge point where like, there are plenty of people who like they do not care. They do not care about the kids. They should not be working with children. And they're just

Simon Cullen
continue I'm sorry for interrupting please continue.

Unknown Speaker
No, you're fine. But it's it's it's tough because you see them working alongside you. And there's not much you can do because if you stick your neck out and you make conscientious objections as you would in any other Workplace because I've worked for many different companies from small family owned businesses to like multibillion dollar corporations. That's how it works. Like that's how supervision works. That's how accountability works. That's how teams work. And like these people just don't get it. It's like they're from another planet. And they've deluded themselves, almost like an indoctrination where they've gone like, No, this is how it works. Like if someone refuses to do what a BCBA says, Even if what the BCBA said was probably unethical. That's unprofessional behavior, write them up. And I'm just like, where are you guys getting this from? Like, it's completely illogical. Yeah. So he, I don't know if that helped answer the question.

Simon Cullen
Oh, I mean, again, super helpful and a lot to unpack. I feel like I'm gonna want to talk to you. Again, I want to add a bit of time to think about what you're telling me, I do want to go back to a couple of things. So one thing you pointed out that was really striking is that the pathway you're taking, which would be the one I would argue should be at least some understanding of contemporary developmental psychology, yes, should be mandated. For a really vulnerable population of developmentally disabled children. That would seem to be very sensible. But what I have found is, as far as I can tell, for example, by reviewing some of the training materials at some of these ABA masters levels, there is very little medical, very little instruction on what we've learned in experimental psychology. And as you mentioned, in neuro psychology, about development. But even more striking it, I would have thought that this training would at least attempt to make you some kind of expert in autism. But actually, autism isn't the focus, the focus is behavior. And I started reading the journal of applied behavior analysis. And yeah, it's really article after article after article about a new technique to manipulate or fine tune or in others like me, and that is really sophisticated stuff. But it is hardly about autism. And actually, one of the questions that I usually ask people is, do you think ABA should be used with neurotypical children? And almost all of them say, yes, yeah. It's really striking to me. I, I wonder, man, I guess a lot of things you said there, suggests that you're going to be working in situations where, I mean, you said you said this yourself where, you know, this isn't good for the clients. And I wonder, partly, you know, the impact of this interview is, I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna go with this. I definitely, deeply devoted to bringing attention to this issue. Especially I was the first my student I, we went to look at, like, what's going on, and we just got it very quickly. No one has ever talked to the RBTs. And I was like, That is insane. The obviously, I mean, the BAC B's own rule is, they only need to be supervised 5% of the time. So they are potentially delivering 95% of this. They know these kids, they know these clients, they weren't like that, and I was talking to a BCBA. And she's like, this is this was direct. Like she said, The RBTs don't know what they don't know. I can look at some data. She means like a graph with with points. In a few minutes. I know everything I need to know. I was just sitting there going like, I have you had any training about like confirmation bias, or yes, me concern. But no, it was just supreme confidence. And you mentioned also this sort of power imbalance. I have heard that over and over again, BCBAs somehow have this weird relationship, sometimes with the RBTs. All of this, I think, you know, goes to say, I do think that the sort of concrete stories from people like yourself are really powerful. So I'm curious, you know, examples where you've seen these problems emerge in ways that were a you know, you already told me about a situation where an RBT could be harmed. And I think you're totally right to draw attention to that. What about also the clients? Have you seen this really percolate all the way to where we were we went to the true nightmare situations?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, honestly. And it was something where I did have to threaten to quit. Because the way that this client was being treated in front of me, once we got through the whole, like, Okay, if this is something where you require me to treat a child this way, document it, write it down. If it's totally kosher, then what's the problem and including that in his treatment plan that's reviewed by his parents and insurance and management? Because I don't trust the shit. Um, well, and I didn't say it like that. But once we hit that point, she would just come in and like verbally harassed this poor child. And it's kind of like the other examples that you shared where the BCBA couldn't hear Him clearly enough. So that wasn't a manned. And it's like, yeah, well, your face was in your computer, you were typing away at 40 Other things you weren't paying attention. And now when I'm telling you explicitly, he said, ABC, and you're in Well, I didn't hear ABC, like, I don't like what am I supposed to say to you? Like he said it. So that's the reality, whether or not you were able to hear it if we want to shape his vocal behavior. So it's more understandable to novel individuals. That's a separate phase. But if we're talking about functional communication, he fucking told you. So like, Listen, before you start punishing this poor kid, and it's just like, honestly, it's like this kind of like abusive, gaslighting, like some of these people. First of all, they're typically under the age of 30. And like, I'm 30. So like, I'm not that old. But I feel like I'm older, to have more, I don't know, just like perspective in life, on what's important, and what's really fucking traumatic. And like the principles of like escape extinction and sensory extinction and like, attention extinction, like planned ignoring, I'm just like, Okay, some of these things can be effective. But like, there are codes of ethics in place, because there are many things we can do to people that are effective, but they are not ethical. And that's where I still come into a lot of conflict with even my own supervisor who like is on the whole, a very moral individual and like a good BCBA we still get into like these big arguments about like, Well, should our four year old girl be able to make bracelets, even if like, sometimes she throws a fit when she can't take them home? Or should we remove all potent reinforcement while still keeping these potent demands in place? And for me, I'm like, No. Like, we're asking this four year old to do crazy shit that like cognitively she shouldn't be able to do. And we just expect her to like, do it. Because like, What the fuck are you talking about? And again, pardon my French, I don't speak like this in the workplace, but it's just like,

Simon Cullen
totally understand. Do you want?

Unknown Speaker
It's crazy? So um, yeah, unfortunately, I think I think many clients, I can see why so many autistic people have come out against ABA, because it can be weaponized against them. And it's, it's the most like neuro typical, biased garbage that I'm like, What are we doing here? And even, you know, against staff members, there's a lot of like, cultural bias. But yeah, these poor kids, I think, a lot of the time, we are very, very hard on them. And while I can't know for a fact, I do very much worry about how it's going to impact them long term, which is part of the B ACB code of ethics. And it's like for me, when I look at like, my child and developmental psychology background, my personal background, my ethical obligations, and I go like, Huh, well, all of these things that we're learning about with like, escape extinction and prepper, and like, oh, you had two kids, and one of them didn't seem to care about sitting at a table for 40 hours a week and complying with every demand. So that must mean it doesn't really matter. I'm like, the social validity of this is absurd, and like we need to be contextualized doing this research. Because like I came across something the other day of like, you should never try to teach a child alternative communication, unless you know for a fact that they will never have vocal speech which is cool. I'm completely against modern research in like speak speech language pathology. And yet it's still being taught. And again, like, my coursework is pretty intensive. And so these are like, pretty good sources, but they still have this garbage that like, if I were not myself and had my own background, which many people don't have, I would then go, Oh, see, we should never like we shouldn't give that kid a device. We shouldn't give him a way to communicate because he needs to learn how to speak vocally and it's like, Dude, that's not okay. Like, again.

Simon Cullen
Yeah. Gosh, okay. i One question I have is, you know, I part of the reason why my ears pricked up when an undergraduate told me about ABA was so he, his brother had been had been diagnosed with ASD when he was a kid and his he saw his brother, his younger brother getting the treatment. And even as a little kid, he was struck by, as he put it, to me, it was extremely punitive and coercive. And I was talking about and he just told me, Oh, you know, well, it's like, behaviorist. I don't like like, behaviorist. What do you mean? Like, yeah. Like, I, I'm a professor in philosophy and psychology, I do cognitive science. I had no idea that there was contemporary behaviorists. I thought, the cognitive revolution in the 60s, obliterated it, no, at these ABA programs, which are in certain universities, predominantly in the Midwest, I find. There are still these academic sinecures where people are living in a 1930s behaviorism. World nearly I mean, it's that's that's a little bit of a caricature, but it's from from that from a regular psychology department, I look at it, I'm just like, what? Yes. And then I started looking into it more and more and more. And it's, you know, it just turned out there was a lot of strange stuff going on. And I cannot help but always return to this thought. Whenever I'm talking to an RBT, that isn't like one of the fairly self aware, intelligent, reflective, ethical, deep thinkers. I hear them and they're like, well, there's the eliciting environment. There's the stimulus. And then there's the behavior and what we're trying to do, and I'm like, hang on, what will what will I agree, the environment, and here's the behavior, but in between the behavior, there's a person with a mind, right? And understand, oh, no, no. We're not meant to document that. Because that's not observable. And I'm like, Holy shit, am I, I have my copy. Am I reading BF Skinner? Right here? You know, is that, like an another? I mean, a parallel world at this point? Yeah. You think like, you've talked about a lot of problems. And I'm sure many of them are not related to the therapies, ultimate sort of grounding in behaviorist science. But even you know, I read we were an email to one of the sort of high priests priestesses of the academic world of ABA, got back this incredibly pretentious reply, criticizing me for not using the terminology correctly, which was my and to the terminology, but basically saying, ABA isn't natural science, and she actually sent me a white paper that said he had in all caps or big caption sections. Aba is a natural science, not a social science. Aba is like physics, we study the natural laws of behavior. I'm not kidding. This is standard, standard language. And I thought this looks from the outside like a very insecure field. Yes. Just like this is deeply insecure. I do not know anyone, none of my cognitive science colleagues, none of my colleagues and ever go around trying to say, well, like physics, we study the natural world. How much of the problems do you think that we're seeing are like, ultimately grounded in this sort of early 20th century behaviorist psychology? And if so, I have a question for you. You know, my question is, why are you still doing

Unknown Speaker
ABA? Yeah, so, um, I do think that is a huge part of the problem, which is why, you know, contextualized research, if you're in a master's program in psychology, you learn about how Freud was influenced by his environment, what, you know, what were the cultural factors, including, like, the time period, the science of the time, his personal life, where he was living in the world, his relationship with women, like, you know, you have to take all of that into account to glean the information properly. You know, if you're going to read through Freud's work, you need to understand what was happening and like what time period and like, what ideas are still helpful? What ideas are garbage, like, you know, because there is bias. And I think that that's something that ABA is very terrible about, you know, this idea of like, this obsessive adherence to behaviorism. And avoiding mentalistic attributions, I'm like, okay, like, I get that. However, I think that like, there are a lot of people who are like, advocating for like new ABA, which is where I'm kind of at, because I had no idea when I started my certification journey, which included like a leap into the deep end that this is what I was going to find. Because my contact with BCBAs, in the direct sport care world was phenomenal. There was a BCBA, who trained myself and my staff. And this was when I was like, 21, and managing a group home, which its own separate thing, but she was just like, here is trauma informed care, that debunks these, you know, Fundamental Attribution errors about like, this person is bad. And they're just doing this for tension. And they, you know, it actually does use principles of behavior to think more about, like, what makes the behavior continue, and what, you know, makes it stop or reduces it. So like, when you come back to those sorts of things, it's it's a more practical, logical approach. But I think where people get hung up is this lack of self awareness in that, like, how we construe private events, which is what people have put in place to basically acknowledge, like, Oh, yes, psychology has come up with some things that are valuable in the past 100 years. It's like a yeah, um, people come back to these fundamental attribution errors, because they go, he's doing it for this reason. And it's like, Well, how'd you get that? And it's like, well, I did a functional analysis. And it showed that it was maintained by attention and escape from demands, I'm like, Yeah, okay. But like, also, our research shows that, like, if it's an undifferentiated, functional analysis, and they're idiosyncratic maintaining variables, and like, all of these things, yeah. I mean, it's like people. It's like, this sounds bad. But I can't help but think many times, like, it's dumb people trying to feel like they're smart without ever having to, like do the work. They just take like a few frameworks and try to like plug and play. But there's so much that they do not understand. And a lot of it is trial and error, which I think like any, you know, therapy that's trying to, like change a person for the better is, but yeah, there's I don't know, I guess, long story long is I'm hoping to take what I've learned throughout this horrible experience working in ABA and make a positive impact. And figure out once I get this certification, like, is that going to allow me to make the changes that I need to see in order to be okay, with this field? Or do I have to make my own path? Because I don't see psychology and ABA is mutually exclusive. And I feel that it's very bad when you do not allow yourself to be informed by the wealth of evidence in psychology and all of the diverse branches. And kind of coming back to that on a quick knock. Quick side note was, I remember going through and it was like, personality psychology, I believe. That was very defensive. They're like, No, don't listen to what anyone else says. We're the ones who know and you're like, but like, what are you do? Like, if it's science, it can help you. Like medical science can help Have you, which is why I love cognitive neuro psychology because it's not the sort of like, Yes, it's my science stay away. It's like, let's synthesize folks like this is a, we're all working together, your site goes.

Simon Cullen
It's like I did my postdoc in neuroscience and in cognitive neuroscience, and it was like one of the coolest experiences of my life. It was, it was amazing. Just scientists from everywhere, not like just not just this narrow field obsessed with its own rigor or something, but just like, what can we learn? What do we know? How do we advance? Yes, it's such an amazing collective experience. It really does strike me when I read like the ABA academic side of things, how insular it is, how dismissive it it frequently is, of alternative views as not scientific and I feel very often, like, there's this almost language and etiology of science and evidence. And look, I am as much for evidence as the next guy. I've devoted my life to trying to find evidence, you know. But it is also part of an ideology that can be used to prop up ultimately things for which there is no evidence and going against sort of common sense evidence of its harmfulness. I, I feel like I have a sense, you know, I talked must have been six months ago now to these BCBAs, two women, fat brilliant women, one masters, one PhD, and they had created their own clinic. And they still the only reason I was talking to them is because they said they practice ABA. About halfway through the interview. I was like, you know, I've read, I've read the official definitions of ABA, and it has these these clauses and you've just categorically denied, like 70% of them. Why do you say you're doing ABA? Why am I talking to you? And she answered very honestly, I wouldn't get to say any clients because I couldn't bill insurance.

Unknown Speaker
Yep. Yep.

Simon Cullen
So is the new APA, people like you. And like, like her, I will use her name, but basically trying to eke out something which is, in some ways antithetical to ABA as it is understood by the people who are high up in ABA. What's going on? What what do we do? What do you want me to do? With all this stuff that I've learned? Like, what am I, I am now sitting on like, huge amounts of interviews and people telling me some really important, like, deeply, deeply important things like, I am just reminded constantly of the fact that we are not just talking about any population, here we are talking about vulnerable population. What do you want me to do with all of this?

Unknown Speaker
That is a good question.

Simon Cullen
I really, I'm not meant to be offloading this on you. Yeah. I'm curious,

Unknown Speaker
helpful. I mean, for me, I would, it's almost like I want to see the research so that like these research obsessed, people, um, you know, have something where I can go, here's scientific evidence of what is happening, it is not just me, it is not, because all Ali's just so anxious, and Uber, which are mentalistic attributes. But it's like, you know, it's not that I'm this, like, weak, overly sentimental, psycho, like, and that's why I'm doing this, it's like, the harm that you're bringing to me can only be magnified for the people below us, and especially these poor children. So it's I, I just want to do anything I possibly can to help get the research out there so that we can kind of have a leg to stand on when it comes to going like, No, I'm not doing that anymore. And these are all of the reasons why it's not ethical for you to continue to operate this way. Because, yeah, I mean, I feel similarly that like, if I were to say that I practice ABA, which like, I don't know, but like as a BCBA, hopefully in the future, I'm not like, I'm not going to adhere to these absurd things, whatever they are, you know, this credo that goes against all of the other evidence that I have as like, you know, a person with an education and as a professional, and as a human being. You know, I'm going to use everything that I can, whether that's like multimodal or whatever it is, to help these kids and to support people so that they can help these kids in the right ways. Um, yeah. So I think that the more we can get conversations out about it and show that like, it is a widespread problem. It's not just people complaining and Berber Berber, and this is just the field, like this is systemic. And that means it's solvable. Because like, we put the systems in place. And, you know, I think OBM, which is organizational behavior management has come up as a new branch of ABA. But it's literally just like, oh, have you ever had management training in your life? Do you know anything about human behavior? Like, yeah, that's how it works. Like, can anyone listen to it? You psychos like, again, it's just it's like, I think there are things that are salvageable. Potentially, but like, it requires the people pushing for change to keep going one way or another, whether it like dissolves the field or create something new, like something has to change what's in place. So you need people that's like, sales terminology, like disruptors, like but you really do you need people who like, will not put down their whatever sort of advocacy and be like, Okay, I'll just quit, I'll just leave the field. It's like, No, I'm not gonna fucking quit. And you're not gonna bully me or harass me into leaving, because like, I am, like, what's needed here? Not you. You know. So it's a kind of like, killing the old guard, for lack of a better,

Simon Cullen
you know, one more detail about how this all started. It was actually the student I told I mentioned, he told me about his brother, he came up to me after I gave a lecture on on self determination theory. And so I am, one of my areas of research is on the importance of autonomy in learning. SDT has sort of posits and painting, yeah, when we talk about evidence based, I mean, I was just doing a literature review. And I counted in the meta analyses, it was like some quarter of a million participants synthesized. And these are results, you know, that have been just turning up over and over. And sometimes when you're working, you know, some of the topics I work on, where we don't really have the theory down, you don't really know if the experiment is going to work. With these SDT interventions, it's astonishing, like it just like you get the sense, like, yeah, there's something deeply true about this, maybe we will deepen our understanding of it. And we are always saying of it. But there is something fundamentally and deeply true about it. And so I was really struck by you know, try, I'm always trying to develop ways to give my students more autonomy. Just like one example, you know, so often, we try to make attendance at classes mandatory. This experience is very coercive, and controlling, which self determination theory says, Should undermine their motivation. And that really sucks for me, because I believe I'm teaching them things which are intrinsically fascinating, and which like, when I was a kid, I just wanted to learn about, and I think my students can do that, too. So instead of mandating that they go to class, well, if I make it totally optional, maybe some of them won't come. So instead, what I do is I give them a choice. I'm like, you can choose if you want to make your attendance mandatory, I call it optional, mandatory. So at the beginning of the semester, you know, you're going to face temptations down the line, do you want now to hold yourself to a commitment that if you don't miss more than three, three meetings, then you know, you can get some bonus. And if you miss more than three meetings, and you're gonna get some punishment, almost all of them choose it. And then at the end, they write about how they just it transformed the way they felt when they were going to class. These are such simple interventions, but they're incredibly effective. So when I was giving this whole lecture to my students, he came up to me, he was like, Have you heard of ABA? Hmm. Like he said to me, um, so, you know, the evidence you provided was very compelling. But does this apply to neuro atypical people? And I was like, you know, that's a fantastic question. I don't know the answer. Why don't you go take a look at the literature, come back and talk to me, you came back to me the next week? And he said, Well, there isn't all that much research. But what I could find suggests that it's even more important for neurotypical people. Autonomy is crucial. And that's what started this project. Yeah. I think, you know, one thing I wonder is, would you be willing, as I said, I will be very, very careful about this transcript. But would you be willing, if I passed your name, say, say, you know, some journalists like the New York Times or The Washington Post or something like that, would you be willing to give an interview to a journalist?

Unknown Speaker
I mean, theoretically, I think, obviously, like, I have to make sure that there's not like a legal issue with anything that I say but

Simon Cullen
if you Probably would figure all that out with them, I think, you know, we'll have their legal legal team who will, you know, tell you like, Should we just use first names? Or should we have pseudonyms and all of that, but I'm not going to be talking to any thing, but like the most reputable people, so I people, I would kind of trust much more than any scientist basically. So yeah, I think there's so many stories here. And I've spoken to so many remarkable people who really care deeply about this. I think that whole bad apples argument is, is really it's a bad faith argument. Nobody knows. And I do want people like you to be able to go and also I want the parents to be able to go to the clinics and say, I want to know about how you're working with your RBTs. Yeah, I want to, I think those sorts of things could create pressure that I don't know if it'll completely change the industry, but it could have meaningful effects on 1000s and 1000s of vulnerable kids lives. And so I would be willing to do that. I think it would be wonderful. I ask that you not mention on social media or anything like that. Because you know, it would be much better for the bseb to not, you know, get hashtag CMU hashtag ABA hashtag investigation? I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I don't actually know what we're gonna do is partly why I'm asking people like you, I'm like, What am I meant? I'm just like, I'm a philosopher. I don't have, like, you know, I'm really I care a lot about this. I really care deeply about it. But yeah, so I'm sort of asking for advice. So one thing I'm, I'm certainly thinking about is this, this story has got everything. And it could be a massive national story. And I think if people like you are willing to talk, then, you know, with appropriate protection for yourself, of course, then I think you actually might be able to make a big difference. Really?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. I mean, honestly, I am open. I'm, I'm a very cautious individual.

Simon Cullen
I mean, you're given a great interview with me today. And like I have, you know, I'll have this anonymized transcript. And if you're comfortable, I can also share that, and then, you know, I think it would be great. I think it would be great, you know, because I'm not a professional journalist. You know, I, I developed these questions by talking to lots of RBTs. And like, just keeping an open ear and an open mind and noticing the things that they said. But I do think it could be particularly good, but I mean, you know, if that's the direction we ended up going, and I think, in some sense, I'm feeling like it's almost we're morally obliged. Like, I definitely can't just sit on it. That is absolutely out of the question. In an academic journal, I have seen some pretty scathing critiques of ABA published in academic journals. Yeah, definitely. They've had any impact. As far as I know, they just get cited by another scathing critique.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, it's, I think it is changing things for some people, but it's typically not the people in power. And I, you know, I can't help but agree, because I was like, Okay, so, am I going to have to spend a ton more money to get my PhD next? Am I going to have to, like go into politics to change things? Like, what is it? So it's like, yeah, if I can contribute in a way, you know, that's not like, legally contentious. I'm more than happy to do so.

Simon Cullen
All right. Well, I'm really grateful for that. I will, like I said, I'm, it's like a sacred duty, I will not. And I certainly wouldn't hand you know, your name to any journalist without your permission in advance. So I think, you know, if if I do end up talking to someone, I'm not going to surprise you or anything with the phone, I'll write to you myself. And then, you know, I'll tell you, you can go look at them, decide if you want to talk to him. But I think that's sort of more and more aware. I am hearing so much, so much about this. Now, that academic journal is where I am at home. It's what I know how to write. But it feels totally inappropriate, frankly. So I mean, we will write if we will write an academic paper as well. I really think this is an issue that needs more than just academics. This, like you just mentioned policymakers. I don't know what you think about this. As far as I know, these clinics are largely or entirely unregulated. Do you think this should be regulated? Do you mean? Um,

Unknown Speaker
it's tough, because I think there are people who are very good at sidestepping the rules in place, you know, like with insurance, there's a lot that's required. But it's enforced so inconsistently that like I got someone's treatment plan from I think it was like Cigna, who's notorious for nitpicking insane things. Um and Like, she didn't have baseline data, she didn't even have goals filled in, she had a template paragraph in and this got approved. So it's like I don't know that more regulation will help unless people take it very seriously because it's more of this, like value based care, which I feel like is becoming more of a conversation, but it's like, how do you quantify that it's so subjective,

Simon Cullen
that sort of what's the etiology of value based care?

Unknown Speaker
Um, so I don't,

Simon Cullen
we've been going for over an hour. So if you gotta, if you gotta take a break, and to take you on talking about the day, just let me know, anytime, okay?

Unknown Speaker
No, it's totally fine. Um, I, I told my husband, I was like, this is really important, Joel. Because I don't know how else to like move this forward on my own. value based care is something that's coming up in like the health care system. And in a weird way, ABA aligns itself with health care systems, despite like, no medical knowledge, which like, I also had, like a pre med background. So that's where I've been, like hopping around being like, what science? Can I help people the most? And how do I make a living, but it's talking more about like social validity and patient centered outcomes. So you're thinking about, for like, doctors, let's say, they will get evaluated and compensated, theoretically, according to like, are their patients having good outcomes? Like, are they healthy? Do they wind up in the emergency room? Or do they have like regular scheduled visits where like, you are providing them with the care to keep them healthy, and well, versus just being like, let's like milk, this guy for a bunch of money. But it's one of those things to where, like, people are going to exploit the system, because then there's going to be even more bias against pre existing conditions, aka people who actually need fucking help. Um, and so that's where I worry, just because I worked in direct support care, as like a group home supervisor, and there's a lot of regulations there. But it's like, while the treatment was not as active, you know, in the traditional sense of like, I'll have a kid who has like 40 programs that were expected to run. I don't even know, like, at least once per hour, and so you're getting like 120 trials per hour. And it's like, these are tough things. If they're actual, like skill acquisition programs.

Simon Cullen
The highest I've heard was 960 per day. Oh, my God,

Unknown Speaker
well, yeah, there you go. Because if he's there for like, eight hours, and you're getting more than 100 per session, right there, but it's like, you know, I went from, oh, let's have this person touch a button. So we can say they're working on communication, to like this other end of the spectrum, and I'm kinda like, I think if we could meet somewhere in between, we'd be really good, because then we can truly get the active treatment that was, you know, the standard of care for direct support care, which is for, you know, teens and adults who early intervention didn't do enough for them, or you know, what I mean, like they are functioning at a level at which like, they can't be super independent, which is going to be a thing for some of our kiddos, especially those with hormone, co morbidities. But it's, it's again, this kind of thing. And I think also one of the challenges is, people have this idea of funding ABA services, based on like a deficit model. But the deficit models like the Do you know, about like the VB map, or

Simon Cullen
is that soft software that is used in the

Unknown Speaker
No, so it's the VB map is like the verbal behavior milestones, right?

Simon Cullen
Yes. The assessment? Yes, I Yes. I haven't actually looked at the assessment instrument myself, but I've heard it.

Unknown Speaker
So it's, it's pretty much like one of the most used statistically speaking across APA, but it's also kind of garbage. Because the and you may know more about this because I just have a master's but it's like A development is not linear, we know this. Now, it's not like a, this is this stage. And this is that stage. And this is the order that they go in. And this VB map tool is based on verbal behavior kind of as conceptualized by Skinner, which as we both know, is not the full picture. Nor are some of the targets even meaningful, and you have a lot of practitioners who use this as the assessment that justifies their services to insurance. And then they also teach according to this assessment, to show the progress is being made. So, it's like, by trying to be quantitative, you're totally missing the point, and how the funding works for certain services misses really important things, like daily living skills, or self care skills, which are like looked down upon as like custodial skills by insurance. But it's something like, Hey, if this kid really needs the intensive behavioral support to learn how to be independent in the bathroom, that could make a very big difference in his life. And like, there's always the chance that like, he's not going to be independent. Because like, that's what I dealt with, with adults who are, you know, they're, they need help with that personal care. And like, to me, it's like, is at the end of the world? No, I don't think so. Um, but is it something where, like, their dignity, and their comfort in life is going to be impacted if like, we fail to teach them a skill that like maybe they're capable of, and we can do it in a way that's not traumatic? or unethical? Like? Yeah, like, of course, let's try to help. Um, but it's, there's all this red tape. And like, from a psychometric tool standpoint, that's also an issue where like, my supervisor, and I got into a huge argument about the barriers portion of the VB map. And the evidence for it is poor, like, even amongst experts in ABA, reliability is moderate to poor. So like, that tells you even if I'm really good, and you're really good, we're probably not going to agree. And if a psychometric tool is that subjective, it's not a good psychometric tool. And this is what like the foundation of services are for a lot of BCBAs, who are not good at their jobs. So yeah, it's like, I think, if there were to be something that could help improve services, it would have to be a more global and developmentally appropriate tool to assess functioning. But it's like, that doesn't really exist. And it like, shouldn't really in some ways, because it's not a one size fits all, like, Oh, you have a 90% score on the development. But it does make it really tricky, because it's kind of like, well, what do you do? And this is a conversation I've had with my supervisor of like, because we don't agree on this thing. And I don't agree with like, saying that this kid has like insane barriers compared to his same age peers, like, do you know, children this age, because like, his same age peers are not good, on average, at like, any of these things. So to say that, like he's falling so far behind, because he can't do A, B and C is preposterous, like, that's not actually consistent with developmental theory, or a typically averaging whatever, typically developing peer, which like, in and of itself, as well, what is that? But it's just very odd. And that's something where they're like, No, you need to understand I'm like, Oh, I do understand, and like, I know, more than you do on the subject of like psychometric tools, apparently. And like, you know, what you're telling me, and how I need to use this to document and like get billable services, so that these children can get the therapy that they need? are two separate things for me. Like I'm not drinking the Kool Aid, that this is a good tool. I think this is garbage. And I think that the way that it makes us have to speak about these children is absurd. But, you know, that's kind of like the catch 22 of like, well, if I have to say that they suck, to get them funding for services, but like, I don't bring that into my practice, fine. You know, so be it if that's the red tape, but I think also that kind of deficit obsessed model does impact a lot of BCBAs. Because then they're like, he can't do this. And he can't do that. I'm like, Why do you say that? And they're like, well, because of his VB map. And I'm like, so you asked him to do something he didn't want to do one time, and he didn't do it. So you're saying he can't do

Simon Cullen
that? Wait, are you serious? Is that how you apply it? Some of

Unknown Speaker
it is, um, and it's not that simple. Like, there are a lot of restrictions around it, where it'll be like, in time does observation of 30 minutes does he spontaneously make eye contact with peers? And this is like a measure of social skills for like, early learners, aka like, 234 year olds, which it's like, yeah, okay, that makes sense. But there are some things where like, people then write programs, like, let's say, we have a five year old who has no interest in his peers, which like, is one of the like, fundamental diagnosis criteria for ASD. That that's not like, that's not something we should be punishing. It's almost like stemming where it's like, we want this person to grow up and be able to function. We want them to understand the rules of society that they need to follow to live their life. But like, quite often this approach of like, well, he needs to make eye contact with peers. And like he's making a typical eye contact. It's like, what, what are you talking about? Like, what's a typical eye contact? Like, what's typical eye contact, everyone I know has a different level of comfort, with eye contact. So like, how is that now a metric? And like, why are we pushing this child to emit this behavior? And that's, that's the thing is like, I feel like people will agree on big picture. But when you get into the details, it gets really weird. Because of course, we want to work on helping them build social skills so that they can function in less restrictive environments. But if that means like, well, I'm going to take the toy away from you, and then I'm going to force you to let another kid hold it. And that's sharing. And it's like, no, that's not what sharing is about. And like that choice in services is a big thing. And like, a cent based services is a huge topic that people completely disregard. And it's like, for me if a kid is having a meltdown, and this is like a four year five year old, so like, they have meltdowns, like all of them do. It's a thing that children do. You know, there's this like, forced them in a into a chair, force them to, like, do heIpIess, which like I hate, like, touch nose, touch head better, blah, this is behavioral momentum, Papa Papa, and like, this is stupid. Like, it's stupid. Like, tell the kid and you know, this is what I have to do. Because I get called in for like crisis support. I'm just like, buddy, like, I'm really sorry, that you're upset. And like, I hear you. And I hear that you're frustrated, but like, I need to keep you safe. And so it's like, if you just want to lay here and cry and scream. Totally fine. Like you can let me know when you're ready. Like to go do fun stuff. Like we can't see mom right now because she's gone. But she's coming back. And like, treat them like a human being, which they are. And, you know, obviously, if me explaining that doesn't make sense to the kid is making it worse than I don't do those things. But nine times out of 10 being empathetic and being like, Hey, I know that you are just trying to like feel better, and get your needs met. And like, here's a better way to do that. And like I can help you work on that when you're not so upset and overwhelmed. What it's like, yeah, there's a lot of people who just make it this really bizarre thing to play with a kid to make it fun to be empathetic. And yeah, I just feel

Simon Cullen
discouraged. Right. I mean, some of that is mental like mental attributions.

Unknown Speaker
Exactly, exactly. And I'm like no like you should Should never be forcing a child to do something like if he's having a meltdown, stop placing demands on him, like, give him a break. Like that should always be an option that like, this kid can say, I don't want to do that. And I can say, Okay, well, then we're not going to get to do all of this other fun stuff, too. That's, you know, goes along with doing the work or whatever it is, like,

Simon Cullen
what a natural consequence. That's exactly,

Unknown Speaker
it's like you, you kind of, you know, it's talking about controlling reinforcers. But it's like, it is a natural consequence of like, there are things in life where like, if you don't put in the work, that is your choice, but you're not going to get all of the fun things that come from doing that work. And like, that's the thing, you know, so I'm not going to like rip something out of a child's hands, but I'm going to say, Okay, well, you can't play with these fun beads with me, unless you want to do a little bit of work first. And like, I know, that sucks. And I get it, but like,

Simon Cullen
maybe it is sucks in some sense. But I gotta tell you, I think your kiddos are. Yeah, there's nothing to complain about with you. They they couldn't understand how lucky they are. To have gotten you. You know, I had a couple of just really quick questions. One was Do you happen to know the test retest reliability of the VB map off the top of your head by any chance? Oh,

Unknown Speaker
I don't. But I know.

Simon Cullen
I'll find it. I'll find it.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, I think especially, I want to say it was like Mark Dixon, because he was developing the peak comprehensive training system, which is actually pretty good, in my opinion. But they did some work. And I know that there's published research because I came across it recently about the reliability, test, retest reliability of the VB map, and just like interrater reliability, which is a huge issue. And those are very interesting, especially if you look at like the research that shows how many people report that that's like the number one tool that they use to assess children and to guide services. It's like,

Simon Cullen
I mean, it's, I understand its dominant, but is it?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, I don't I don't remember off the top of my head. Um, but that is something I mean, like, if we did a follow up, I could probably pretty easily look that up. Um,

Simon Cullen
I'll certainly be looking at as well. Yeah, I would love to do that. I guess. I've had like two questions, which just keep coming into my mind. So one of them is a study that I came across recently, that wasn't a terribly rigorous study, not because of any fault of the authors just because of the nature of what they were investigating. But they reported that in a sample, it was a somewhat self selecting sample, as I recall, of autistic adults who had received ABA as children. 49% of them met the full clinical diagnostic criteria for PTSD related to the treatment that they received. Does that sound to you? Like a believable number, or is that?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, it does, um, sadly. And that's also I feel like that's also what's so important about being in this field right now. Because I don't know that. Well, I do know, I haven't had like an official PTSD diagnosis. But like, a lot of the symptoms and challenges related to PTSD have impacted me throughout my life in retrospect. And that is 100% something where I'm like, I know how the way that adults treated me as a child still affects me and have affected me throughout my life. So I can't tell you for sure that what you're doing is going to lead to long term trauma for this kid. But I can tell you, it's pretty likely. So it's like if you're not sure err on the side of not traumatizing children. And that's literally what I say to people all the time. I'm like, Ellie's first law. Yeah, literally traumatizing. Well put, I'm just like, if it's not fun, and it sucks, and they're really upset all the time, and you're speaking to them in ways that like most people would not approve of, maybe don't fucking do that anymore. Like there are so many other ways to build independence, to build skills to reduce challenging behavior. And like 90% of the time most of the kids Just like wanna play, wanna hug? Want to be understood? Like, you know what I mean? It's like, the basic things that everyone wants. So, yeah, it's a, it's, I don't know. I don't know.

Simon Cullen
No, there's so much to unpack and talk about. And I'm definitely going to chat again, I will want a little while to think through this conversation. Luckily, we have recording, so I can read the transcript and formulate some more questions for you. One thing I am, this always comes to my mind when I'm hearing these stories is, I just can't help imagine myself as a kid. And I know I wasn't developmentally disabled. So it's hard for me to imagine exactly, but I guess I have to work on the assumption. I mean, yes, there are profound, profound levels of disability where I might have very little insight into what it's like to be like that. But I have to work on the assumption that many kids, the fundamental nature of their experience is relatively similar to mine. And I can't help but imagine myself as a kid getting some of these treatments when I'm talking to RBTs, especially the ones who aren't very self aware. And they're just telling me I do this trial. I was telling me when I had come to the question about how often do you give them breaks? Oh, no. And they're with me, they're working. Okay. And I can't help but think to myself, that would have just fucking crushed me as a kid. Like, I don't know that a person could have come out of that. On the other side, who would be recognizably me today? Do you ever feel like the same way?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, and that's something where I feel very strongly about like how I was treated as a child going through the education system. And just in general, because I didn't fit into the right box, I was like an over achiever. Um, so it wasn't like I was being looked down upon for a deficit, which like, certainly comes with its own kind of like ablest bullshit, but, um, it, like, I've experienced firsthand a lot of issues that I still deal with as an adult, because people have this, whatever it is, like affinity bias where they go, like, you don't think like me, so you're wrong, like, You're wrong. And I'm gonna think of reasons why I don't like you. And it's like, I still get that and like, have experienced so much more of it since coming into the field of ABA. Which is, like, just been horrific. Honestly, it's been really hard. For me personally, I'm like, the only thing that really keeps me going is like, the fact that this is so hard for me as an adult who has been through so many years of therapy and is like, so well educated on this topic, like, I have to help, you know, I have to help these kids from all of this bullshit, because like, it's, it's so similar in some ways to the issues with, like, how they treat adults, how they, you know, how these people treat anyone. And I think, you know, a lot of what I see is aligned with a lot of the issues that I have with the education system, because so many people align themselves with it as like the gold standard of like, well, this is how teachers treat them. And it's like, well, teachers fuck people up, like when they don't understand them. And like, a lot of the kids that we work with, have behavioral issues, have communication issues. So like, they're not being understood. They're not being treated fairly. And you know, some of my kids, they're black males from inner city, Chicago. So like, I know, the stakes of helping them survive this world,

Simon Cullen
and getting them on the right track where they feel empowered.

Unknown Speaker
Exactly. And that's a big thing for me is like when they are enforcing their own boundaries. That is really important. And it's going to be really important in their lives, to make sure that they make it. But you know, it also brings to mind like, one of my kids like he is perceived as extremely physically aggressive, but like, I think it's a racial bias. I think people go like, this is a black boy who's now eight, and he's tall. And so when he starts getting antsy, people freak out. out and he was restrained, like, over 600 times in his school year. And that's the other thing is the schools around here, the special education programs are a nightmare. They are awful. Um, and so it's like, like I'm trying what I can do to undo these, like messed up learning histories that are going to make them more aggressive, that are going to be more traumatizing, that are going to lead to more negative behavior in response to this trauma of being assaulted by adults day in and day out. And it's like, you know, he's a kid where like, he could very well be the next kid who gets murdered by the police. And it's like, that's where, obviously, I have my own responsibilities to like, protect my mental health, so that I can continue to provide care, but it's like, the stakes are really high. And like, for some of these people, like who don't give a shit, I'm just like, You have no idea all of the privilege that you have, and how you are like weaponizing that with your bias against these poor children. Especially the ones who are at very high risk. in their lifetime, as they get older, then there'll be violent black men who you know what I mean? Like, it's so yeah, it's like most of my kids I have a very strong relationship with, but especially the boys who are people of color, whether that's like an Indian boy, literally from India, or, you know, a black kid, like, I just like, I cannot be told that, like, I am inappropriate, because I am an advocate against the documented racial discrimination and violence that these children do and will experience. Like, when I see it, I'm like, that is not okay. And like he is being discriminated against, and you cannot tell me that. Me being upset about that is the problem. Like, because it's not, you know what I mean? And it's like these poor kids. But um, yeah, I don't even remember what I was talking about. But

Simon Cullen
oh, no, I've been I've got a whole list of topics that I want to think about and then asked you about, I think, yeah, look, I, I gotta let you go today, you've been so totally, really interesting. And you have given me a lot to think about. So I will, let me get to that. I'll just skip ahead to the end of the script. So I can read out that last bit where I asked for your permission to transcript just give me a sec. And then yeah, I so I've got, you know, pretty hectic schedule of interviewing and working with my students for the next week or two. But then after that, I'll also have had a few meetings with like people pretty high up in ABA sort of academia and regulation, I'm going to be putting a lot of tough questions to them in recording area. So I think maybe after I've because, you know, I do plan to ask them questions that you raised. And I think after that, I would like to talk to you. So I can follow up on, especially things that you were talking to me about about the group activity, we didn't talk at all about the group. I mean, it's an important topic I wanted to learn about, also about the cultural biases against the staff. I'm also curious to learn more about trauma informed care, which I've read a little bit about, but I'd like to hear about it from your perspective. Yeah. So I am also very interested to hear more about the way this might intersect with racing around Chicago. I think that's another important topic that I'm very curious about. So I got a lot of things I'd love to have a discussion with you. Let me just get get us to the end of this. This file Sorry, just give me a moment is one past the last page? Usually I go through a lot of questions. I got the I got all right. So yeah, I want to ask if you're comfortable with my team sharing the anonymized transcript of today's interview with interested parties, for example, researchers at my own institution, to be very clear That would not include any details that can be used to identify you. Yes. Okay. And what about the audio recording? Are you happy for me to share that to remember, it would not include your name or other identifying details? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
I think that's fine.

Simon Cullen
You seem a little bit less confident about that you feel absolutely free to say no, I really did not want you to feel the least pressure or concern about any of this. So the transcript is enough. If you're happy. If you want the transcript, I'll say no to the audio.

Unknown Speaker
No, I think the audio would be fine. I was like, I had to think about it sounds like that's more personally identifying. But I think it's, it's fine. Because again, if it, you know, negatively impacts my career in ABA, so be it. You know what I mean? Because it's like, this is what I'm about folks.

Simon Cullen
I really, I mean, I admire you for many, many reasons. And that's just another, but I give you my word, I will be very careful. The audio recording will be associated with where I don't know what clinic you work at. Thankfully, you haven't told me which is good. And it won't be associated with what state you're in or anything. So it should be unless someone who actually talks to you everyday listens to it. They wouldn't know who

Unknown Speaker
like, Oh, I know. That's her. She said this to me a million times. I'll be like, yeah, keep saying it.

Simon Cullen
All right. So um, thank you so much. I really deeply appreciate your time, and much more than even your time, just that you're there in those clinics, and that you're working with these kids and that you have that you're thinking for yourself and deeply. And i i Maybe the kids are not really able to quite appreciate it for what it is, but I really do. So thank you very much. Thank you. I'll be in touch in a couple couple of weeks and I'll let you know how that goes.

Unknown Speaker
Perfect. Well, thank you so much. I appreciate it.

Simon Cullen
It was wonderful meeting you.

Unknown Speaker
Thank you. Take care.
