Simon Cullen
Okay, I'm just going to ask you the same question again. Are you happy for me to record the interview?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Right.

Simon Cullen
Okay. Well, we are going to be talking today about ABA therapy. I just wanted to start off with some background questions about you. So you're what is your cerveza not? Okay, I've got to adjust this because I had it for Clarissa. Okay. So which state you're currently working

Unknown Speaker
in? Which which state? Yeah, California. Oh, beautiful. I bet it's gorgeous over there right now.

Unknown Speaker
It is. I mean, we're having a heatwave, like everywhere else. But

Simon Cullen
really, I spent, like one year in California, and it was the most beautiful year of my life. I kind of don't know why anyone would live anywhere else at this point. So what's the highest level of education you have achieved so

Unknown Speaker
far? Masters? Okay.

Simon Cullen
And for how many years? Have you been working with clients in ABA in any capacity?

Unknown Speaker
Since 2017, so six years?

Simon Cullen
And where do you deliver therapy at the home center school or elsewhere?

Unknown Speaker
Um, usually in clinic or in home, sometimes in community or very occasionally in schools? Okay,

Simon Cullen
I'll leave in school out since it's much less likely than home center and community. So which credentials do you currently hold from the BAC Bay?

Unknown Speaker
So I have my RBT Great.

Simon Cullen
Do you have any plans to become a BCA be

Unknown Speaker
at any point? BCA V? Yeah. I'm so no,

Unknown Speaker
if I was going to do if, I think if anything, I would get my BCBA sorry, that.

Simon Cullen
That's what I meant to ask, did I? Excuse me, I'm just gonna make drinks because my throat is dry.

Unknown Speaker
That's all right. Excuse me?

Simon Cullen
No, I meant to say BCBA. If you if you ever wondered,

Unknown Speaker
oh, um, I, uh, I might. Okay. It possibly.

Unknown Speaker
I'm applying to medical school right now. So if I don't get in this cycle, then I guess, I think I'll take the BCBA exam.

Unknown Speaker
Okay.

Unknown Speaker
Okay,

Simon Cullen
well, um, one thing we're interested in here is whether or not RB T's are paid fairly for their work. And so I am saying you don't want to tell telling me this. But if you don't mind, what was your starting position, your starting salary in your very first position as an RBT

Unknown Speaker
$16 an hour. And did you feel like that was fair? Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Okay. Did your position provide health insurance?

Unknown Speaker
No. Okay.

Unknown Speaker
I did feel that it was fair, but now that I know more, I realized that it was pretty bad. Pretty bad situation all around.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Okay. Well,

Simon Cullen
I'm definitely gonna want to find out a bit more about that. So what is your current RBT? Salary?

Unknown Speaker
Ah.

Unknown Speaker
Um, let me think it's just changed. That's okay. Take your time. Think? I think oh, I think it's 2578. Okay, yeah. Great. Thank you.

Simon Cullen
Okay, and does your current position provide health insurance?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. Excellent. Okay.

Simon Cullen
So how many hours a week do you work in total considering all of the clients that you see? Um,

Unknown Speaker
thanks. Look at that right now.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, great. It's I'm full time so how many hours a week so.

Unknown Speaker
Huh,

Simon Cullen
we can use like just approximately

Unknown Speaker
53.42 hours a week. Wow. Okay. 53.4

Simon Cullen
All right. Um, and how many hours? Do you work with an average client?

Unknown Speaker
Um, between? With the average clients, I were at least three hours. Okay,

Simon Cullen
is there a range from three to something?

Unknown Speaker
The range is from two hours to five

Unknown Speaker
hours.

Simon Cullen
Okay, great. So how many clients are you currently working with?

Unknown Speaker
I'm working with 11234.

Simon Cullen
Okay. So I just want to make sure I understand. So you're working a total of about 53.5 hours a week with four clients in total. And so that would mean more like 12 hours per client. So what have I misunderstood something?

Unknown Speaker
Well, that's why I'm looking at this because it doesn't really look right.

Simon Cullen
We'll just just say from from memory, like, roughly. You know, I've heard some some people working with the same client, you know, 10 to 30, or even 40 hours a week.

Unknown Speaker
I think I mean, I work. Let me look at my

Unknown Speaker
let me look at my pay. This, it says, and it says my hours authorized by insurance are only eight, which makes no sense. I mean, unless everybody's authorization is pending. Hmm.

Simon Cullen
Well, maybe you could just tell me like, historically, over the last year or something

Unknown Speaker
I'm 40 hours a week. Okay. But, yeah, yeah. So

Simon Cullen
that would be about 10 hours per client,

Unknown Speaker
and an hours per client per week. Okay. I said with the range when I said, Five to two hours. That's not that's per session. Okay. So like,

Simon Cullen
I say, Okay, right. Right. Okay. So let's see. So that would be something like, What did you say to all right. Great, thank you. Okay, so what is the average length of a full treatment program at your clinic? How many months or years do the kids tend to stay?

Unknown Speaker
Well, I would say they stay. They seem to stay

Unknown Speaker
I would say over three years, because it's they don't like we don't

Unknown Speaker
I've never had a client that we just graduate as in like they have met all their goals, because we keep on refining the goals and expanding them and targeting them in different locations, different contexts with different people. Okay,

Simon Cullen
so some RBTs have mentioned that turnover staff turnover at their clinic is very high because people are getting burnt out by long hours. On average, how many years to RBTs stay at the clinic where you work currently.

Unknown Speaker
I think probably like one year winning half,

Simon Cullen
one to 1.5. And would you say that there's a concerning level of burnout?

Unknown Speaker
Um, yeah, but I

Unknown Speaker
actually I don't know that it has to do with long hours. It has more to do with the logistics of you might have a session in the morning and then you have a really long gap. But you can go home like you can kind of aren't really free to do

Unknown Speaker
a lot during that time. I mean, most people often I don't ever hear people complaining that they don't get

Unknown Speaker
long enough hours they complain they don't get enough support from their bcva They don't understand. They don't get enough training, they don't understand what's going on they. And they recognize that they could be paid a lot more elsewhere and have more opportunities for advancement elsewhere because we hire very, very few BCBAs and assistant supervisors.

Simon Cullen
Okay, yeah. Those are all things I've certainly heard from talking to many RBTs. Now. So considering both the training and the education provided by the BAC, B, and buy your first supervisor, your very first, do you think that that training prevent prepared you for your first day working with the client?

Unknown Speaker
No, I

Unknown Speaker
don't think the training did.

Simon Cullen
So how would you describe the training that you received from the BAC B in the RBT? Module?

Unknown Speaker
Well, it's still very

Unknown Speaker
used, it's not as if it's not useful.

Unknown Speaker
Um,

Unknown Speaker
but you really don't know what you're doing until you have spent a significant amount of time with a client. And once you have been working with a lot of clients, then maybe you will be your learning curve will be. You'll learn more quickly with each client you work with. Yeah, but I think like fluency just really comes from working in the field and having a good mentors. Yeah. Because, like you'd like something that you learn in 40 hours, it's a really great, that's a really great starting point. But you have to be continuing to learn all that stuff. Like the eyes, they don't they like they don't know what shaping is. They don't know, like how to prevent prompt dependence. They don't understand like least the most intrusive prompting, and when, like, stuff like that, that I think is really important. That's the kind of stuff that they're learning on the job.

Simon Cullen
No, absolutely. So would you say then that the training from the BAC B could be would be sufficient for other people? Or generally, this would be something that

Unknown Speaker
no, I think, I think in general RBTs are really really like undertrained. They have the bare minimum of training.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, that's certainly something I've heard from lots of RBTs. Now. So did the training and education provided by the BAC be discussed the potential for abuse in ABA therapy? And if so, do you feel like the training provided adequate protection against potential abuse of clients?

Unknown Speaker
No, it did not.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, so

Simon Cullen
I know typically, it's the BCA B, who is going to interact with the family, especially when they first come to the clinic. But just speaking in your own words, how would you define ABA? To a new family that's looking for therapy?

Unknown Speaker
I would say that ABA is about working with

Unknown Speaker
working with the person's behavior, rather than working against it. It's about standing the functions of the behavior and changing those behaviors. I mean, ideally, with function based interventions, with understanding with understanding the behavior in order to change it, or to keep like keep good behavior, going, like because a lot of parents, a lot of parents, a lot of families, really, only they give their kids the most attention for what they do wrong. Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, that's great. So in your mind, then how would you describe the goal of ABA therapy?

Unknown Speaker
Um,

Unknown Speaker
I think the goal of ABA therapy as I see it, it should it should be to empower those children and their families throughout their lifetime.

Unknown Speaker
So there should be learning skills

Unknown Speaker
that they will be using that will help them throughout their life.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, I think that's a that's a great goal. So do you think ABA could help children without autism and would you consider using ABA on to help a neurotypical kid?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, absolutely.

Simon Cullen
Have you ever I'm you You know, from talking to some parents who have done ABA with their autistic child, they've often said, you know how great they think it could be for their neurotypical child? Do you know if anyone actually gets treatment for neurotypical children? Or is that not really possible?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, it certainly could be possible. But I don't think parents understand. I don't think parents go after that. Because it's kind of only known about in the, like, for people with autism, they get referred for it. Yeah. But parents generally don't know. Like, how beneficial even for even if their parents have an autistic child, they don't necessarily know how beneficial like a diagnosis of autism would be. For a any child in terms of accessing services.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. I certainly had people talking about the how you need that diagnosis to get insurance to help you with these sorts of things. Yeah. So moving on to talking about the supervision that you've received as an RBT. And thinking about that the whole period, including when you're just starting out and any other clinics that you've worked at, have you always been satisfied by the quality of your supervision?

Unknown Speaker
No, no, I'm alright. And I think that

Unknown Speaker
the biggest issue that I've had with supervision is that the supervisor

Unknown Speaker
is wrong.

Simon Cullen
So he was giving.

Unknown Speaker
Usually, well, I mean, just because of the prevalence of females in this field, it's usually been female supervisor, you can't say to them, Look, I don't think like, I don't think that that strategy is going to be helpful to this person in the long term. Because they say, they say, Well, I Well, this is like, I believe it's the best because it's research shows, it's the best I go into the peer reviewed literature like, I show them like, and it's not the best. And like, I have the same degree as you. But you'll listen to me because I don't know. That's just the way people are they like when they have somebody really likes doing things one way. It's not so easy to show them how to tell them to do it a different way. Sometimes you can kind of show them that there are different ways better, but they're really resistant.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's focus on when you just started working as an RBT only say, the first year of your position. Could you describe what supervision generally looks like during that time.

Unknown Speaker
Um, my supervisor was really good with like, giving me feedback, feedback and instructions. Like she gave me written feedback, she modeled things, but one thing that kind of bothered me was she didn't, if she wanted me to implement something, she wouldn't necessarily tell me why. And if I asked why she would give a reason, like, well, you know, just everybody should do that. And I felt that was really lacking.

Simon Cullen
What what? Could you give me an example of some of the things by you, you wanted to understand why she wanted you to do that, but she didn't think it needed an explanation. Do you remember any examples?

Unknown Speaker
Well, yes, in so she really wanted to do a visual schedule. And their visual schedules are really helpful to some of my kids. Um, but at the time, like, I was very new to ABA, and I didn't, never had like, part of like, writing a schedule out for the session. And I just it didn't seem I'm sure she must have been like, what what are you talking about? But she? I said, Well, why? Why he doesn't want the schedule. He's upset about the schedule, because it's like it, it makes it the I think it makes everything seem too rigid or inflexible and no opportunity for improvisation. So basically, why does he Why do we have to use the visual schedule? We're doing fine without it? And she said, Well, you know, it's always just good to have a schedule. Like even when I go to out to do errands, I have like a checklist with little boxes that I like to check things off. Even if it's just two things. It's always good to have a schedule. I just wanted something more than that. Like,

Unknown Speaker
if she could have at least showed me like,

Unknown Speaker
the research behind it. He felt that that wasn't that it was just so intuitively, like, important to have a schedule.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. From her perspective, that there was no need for explanation. Right.

Simon Cullen
So how many hours during that so the first year How many hours per week would you make with her? Oh,

Unknown Speaker
probably probably half the hours. If I've seen my client 10 hours a week, I'd see her five hours a week.

Simon Cullen
Okay, 50% That's pretty good. I've heard people telling me like 5% of times.

Unknown Speaker
So that's Oh, yeah. Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off. What were you saying?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, that's okay. I would say like, I think that it was more to like, the 5% is more typical. Now, for me now that I'm, like, pretty established.

Unknown Speaker
Okay. Well,

Simon Cullen
that's my next question is like how, if at all, has supervision changed? For you?

Unknown Speaker
Um,

Unknown Speaker
I get a lot less supervision. But I know that I can. If I ask for more, if I asked for more support, I will get it. I have just a lot more independence. Um, I collaborate with my supervisors, a lot more in program design, and like writing operational definitions, and I mean, all this stuff's kind of stuff that you do, you can do for your

Unknown Speaker
unrestricted hours.

Simon Cullen
Right. Okay. So how many hours per week? Would you meet with your BCBA? Now?

Unknown Speaker
On average? Probably on average one. Okay.

Simon Cullen
Well, I guess you kind of just mentioned that, but does your BCBA have asked for your feedback? When creating? Yeah, that's great. So generally speaking, do you feel respected where you work?

Unknown Speaker
I do feel respected. Um, I think when I times when I don't feel respected is, um, what just kind of situations like what I described, where people assume that their particular perspective is universal, like the perspective that schedules are important, every day. Or the perspective that children should always comply immediately, like being compliance is intrinsically like a good thing.

Simon Cullen
Okay, we're definitely going to talk about that. Okay, I just want to make sure I'm getting everything you told me accurately recorded. Okay, so the first question about the sort of range of treatments and behaviors that you work on, is, do you ever work on stimming behaviors, and I don't mean, necessarily trying to eliminate stimming, but trying to modify stimming, or anything like that,

Unknown Speaker
I do try to support my clients with stimming. Like, if I noticed that they are, for example, I have a 10 year old who I'm, when I started with him two years ago, he was sucking his thumb a lot and it was affecting his dentition. So his bite was he was getting an open bite, and you know, it's going to be bad for his teeth.

Unknown Speaker
So we,

Unknown Speaker
I would just say to him, like give your give your T space. And like I showed him pictures of like, the of like this the type of fight that sometimes develops with some thumb sucking and why it's important for his teeth to have enough space to grow without that thumb crowding them.

Unknown Speaker
Um,

Unknown Speaker
and that was, that was a stimming behavior that I was able to eliminate for the most part. It because it was something that seemed to just happen absent mindedly if he has other oral pressure seeking behaviors. And with that, I tried to support it by providing safe clean things for him to get that world pressure. Okay.

Simon Cullen
Any other examples of stimming behaviors? Like maybe hand flapping or anything

Unknown Speaker
like that? So if it's

Unknown Speaker
not, it's not gonna, it's not affecting the bodies to fallot mints, or actually causing harm, like skin picking, or skin biting yourself or sucking on your fingers, then it's not something addressed like hand flapping. That's not something that it would even be part of programming.

Simon Cullen
Okay, well, it's, um, yeah, that's certainly not what every IBT we've talked to has told us, but that's, that's great. So So you would say you would only address or try to modify stimming behavior when it when it could physically harm the child?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Or yeah, yeah. I mean, the oral pressure seeking can be a problem because there are a lot of times they're putting things in their mouth. It's not clean.

Simon Cullen
So does your clinic ever help kids work with

Unknown Speaker
eye contact? Oh,

Unknown Speaker
I'm not the naughty RVT some not really, officially, I don't think it's not like a programming goal for any of our clients. I've never seen that. But there are certain BCBAs and like, we have occupational therapists on the team, too. And some of them will be like, Look, Where's where's your eyes? Where are my eyes? Like? I let me see you. And they like that, because they feel that eye contact is important. But we on the ABA side, and really like the people who understand

Unknown Speaker
don't push eye contact.

Simon Cullen
So what do so when eye contact is addressed? What is the goal of addressing it isn't primarily social.

Unknown Speaker
I think it's just like, like the people are like, it's the same thing. Like when you walk past when somebody will walk past a child in the hallway, and they'll say, hi, hi, hi. And they'll get in their face until they say hi back, because they think it's good for the child to say hi. Back to them. They just think eye contact is good. But like I said, it's not something that we would address in programming. It's more so just like the idiosyncrasies of specific clinicians?

Simon Cullen
I say, Yeah. And do you personally think that it should be something that is not addressed? are

Unknown Speaker
a? Oh, yes, yes. No, we should not be addressed. If somebody is missing, like, if you can't

Unknown Speaker
I tell?

Unknown Speaker
Well, okay, so if my clients mouth is pointed away from me, it's really hard for me to hear what they're trying to say to me. But their eyes being pointed away from me, like, what, it doesn't matter. It's just distracting to have taken in all that facial information. And if it helps communication, to have the eyes pointed away,

Unknown Speaker
then that's fine.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, I mean, what you just said is really what I think a lot of autistic people are now saying, so. Okay, so autistic kids sometimes will obsessively focus on a single narrow topic for conversation. For example, maybe a client only ever wants to talk about trains or even a particular train? Do you ever work with kids to help them develop broader interests or topics of conversation?

Unknown Speaker
I wouldn't really say that the goal? Well, one thing that I do focus on is if you ask me the exact same question multiple times a day, I like to provide some support in thinking of different questions you might want to ask me.

Unknown Speaker
So it's not

Unknown Speaker
like, if you asked me a different question, if you asked me 10 different questions. I wouldn't care if they were all about the same topic. I would be really glad that you are finding different, like, ways to use that topic to engage with me.

Simon Cullen
Yeah. Okay, that sounds great. Um, so. So I guess you wouldn't say you're trying to help them develop broader interest is in other topics. So you mustn't talk about, say, your favorite train, or Spongebob, or whatever. You can talk about that topic, which you really love. But let's try and expand the range of questions that we ask about that topic. Is that

Unknown Speaker
gonna really be inappropriate? What do you mean, I've only really encountered that word. If it's something that it's really appropriate, and like I have, like my 10 year old, went through a phase where he would say, do you open your body? And I'm like, it's gonna be really weird if you keep saying

Unknown Speaker
that to everybody you meet.

Unknown Speaker
So we tried to not talk about opening one's body.

Simon Cullen
So does your clinic ever work with kids who have problem behaviors that involve hurting themselves? Yeah. What percentage of kids that are treated at your clinic would you say have self injurious behaviors?

Unknown Speaker
Um I think it's

Unknown Speaker
would have to be a really low percentage. I don't see it. I see like skin picking

Unknown Speaker
the most. Um, percent.

Simon Cullen
Okay. All right. So very low. So like, one in 20 or something like that. Yeah. And are you personally working with any kids who have this problem?

Unknown Speaker
Not right now. In the past, though, you have, yeah, some of my clients have struggled with with skin picking. But I have seen that it seems to have gotten better.

Unknown Speaker
With just having

Unknown Speaker
I had a client who was doing when she started extracurricular activities, she started doing a color guard. She her skin picking seem to go down. Maybe? And I'm not sure if that's just a coincidence, or, or what but so she skin picking doesn't seem to be a problem for her anymore.

Simon Cullen
That's great. So is this picking to the point where the kid would make themselves bleed? Or have scabs and things like that?

Unknown Speaker
I'm not with this client, but her brother who I also worked with? He Yes, he did. But he's now in residential treatment. So

Unknown Speaker
I'm not

Unknown Speaker
sure if he's still struggling with skin picking. Yeah.

Unknown Speaker
I want to ask about that.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so I'm going to just read a list of behaviors that you might work with your clients on. So just so we have enough time to kind of go into the deep questions that are coming up. All I need for this was a yes or no. So whether or not you work with clients on safety? Yes. Okay. autonomy and independence. Yes. Asking for their own needs. Yes. following commands. No. Appearing neurotypical.

Unknown Speaker
Well, no. Okay. sitting still.

Unknown Speaker
No, I mean, some of these things are in programming, but I don't, um, target them as such.

Simon Cullen
I see. So which would be in in the programming.

Unknown Speaker
So that my 10 year

Unknown Speaker
old, he has like a focusing on seated activity for 20 minutes. And I basically, I just target that with a preferred activity.

Simon Cullen
So it's not like training, you're not training him to sit still, but rather, training in the context of this activity that he enjoys?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, it's just like, can he focus on can he focus on something that he enjoys? For 20 minutes? And he really, yeah, anyway, so without getting into too much detail, it's not about sitting still.

Unknown Speaker
And the other one was following commands. Yes, I target. I have that in programming for my three year old that I work with. But if she doesn't, if I tell her to do something, and she doesn't want to do it,

Unknown Speaker
then that's fine.

Unknown Speaker
Like, it's not a safety issue. If she and I like to support her and letting me know, like, the other day, I was like, let's go to the bathroom. Let's go take a potty break now. And, and that would be to me, I would count that as one step instruction, let's go take a potty break. I'm not gonna say we're taking a potty break now. I mean, sometimes I might, but it's never like, you have to do it for the sake of like, following the instruction in she started. So I said, let's go take a potty break. And she started crying. As if like, she would have no choice. And she was walking to go to the potty and crying as if she would have no choice but to go do it even though she really didn't want to. And I said hey, like it's already like, if you want to go later, you can you can say not right now or later. So it's more like that. If, if it's something if it's not a safety thing, then the behavior that I'm trying to teach is either listening and following through with the instruction, or self advocating like, I don't want to do that right now. Or can I have a little bit more time doing this other activity, stuff like that?

Simon Cullen
All right, I'm gonna continue down the list. So social interaction. Yes, behaviors that could hurt other people. Yes, behaviors that could hurt the client. Yes, distracting behaviors.

Unknown Speaker
Yes, but only with my 14 year old client

Unknown Speaker
don't think colored. Let me just make a note about that. So

Simon Cullen
distracting behaviors only with focus only with the older client 14 years.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Isn't because they part of being a team on the team is like everybody needs to be able to she needs to be able to listen and everybody else needs to be able to listen to the

Unknown Speaker
coach.

Unknown Speaker
So, but that is really difficult. We could maybe talk more about that later.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Okay. For

Simon Cullen
sure. So escape behaviors.

Unknown Speaker
I'm not as such. Okay. elopement. Yes. Okay. Screaming? Yes. Past refusal? Yes. Okay.

Simon Cullen
So, I'm going to do another list that we can get through pretty fast before we get onto some deeper questions. So I'll read the list of people who might be involved in creating or modifying a client's treatment plan. And for each person I list, please tell me if they ever provide input on deciding what behaviors you're going to work on with the clients. So first of all, the BCBA?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. What about the parents? Yes.

Simon Cullen
What about other therapists like speech therapists or occupational therapists or food therapists?

Unknown Speaker
Yes.

Simon Cullen
Okay. What about other caregivers? Apart from the parents?

Unknown Speaker
Yes. Okay. School teachers. Know, school officials know, the client themselves? Yes. Okay.

Simon Cullen
Great. All right. So after you after completing, not necessarily with you, but just at your client, your clinic generally, what percentage of clients wouldn't seem autistic to someone they just met? So in other words, what percentage of clients would pass as normal? At least like to a stranger who just meets them quite briefly?

Unknown Speaker
I don't think they I don't know. Okay, but I

Unknown Speaker
guess it makes it It certainly makes it easier for them to pass if they're if they're maybe like if they're not screaming. Yeah, like, some clients. I've had worked with clients who scream as like, self stimulatory behavior is like, a form of protest, because they don't have other ways to communicate anxiety, excitement.

Unknown Speaker
And so I would say, but I don't think I've ever really worked with. I've never

Unknown Speaker
really thought about that. And I don't think.

Unknown Speaker
No, okay,

Simon Cullen
well, let's move. Let's move on from Guinea. Okay, so can you please describe the language skills of an average client that you work with at the beginning of their treatment? And maybe you can describe it in terms of like, how far behind non autistic kids would they be on average?

Unknown Speaker
I'm with the average kid. Yeah. Okay, well, what's typical? Um, well, I've worked with non

Unknown Speaker
speaking kids who use only an AAC device.

Unknown Speaker
And I've worked with kids who I would say on average. The kids that I work with,

Unknown Speaker
are the average kid that I work with. Speaking, like, they're speaking, they're, they're using their voice to communicate.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, in full is or partial, full sentences.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so in full in full or partial fragment three sentences. Okay. But I've definitely

Unknown Speaker
worked like with a range. Yeah.

Simon Cullen
Well, I'm gonna ask him about the challenges of doing that in a moment.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, so.

Simon Cullen
So considering now the average client at the end of the full course of treatment, I think you said that can be a few years. How are their language skills improved? And if so, how much have they improved if you tried to just step back and think very objectively about the average amount of improvement

Unknown Speaker
that you observed? Right I've observed a lot of, like, significant

Unknown Speaker
improvement like enough that I'm, I'm excited about it. I mean, really speak to the end of course of treatment, because I've never, I've never seen a client just to the end, I would love to do that. But when I've stopped working with a client, it's always been because of some like scheduling change. Like they they're going they were homeschooled before, and now they're going to school.

Unknown Speaker
Ah,

Simon Cullen
okay, that must be difficult.

Unknown Speaker
Okay. All right. Yes, no,

Simon Cullen
sorry, please, I didn't mean to cut you off, please continue.

Unknown Speaker
It depends. Like I'm, I'm, I'm not pleased that I can't work with my 11 year old who's in residential care. I wish I was more involved in his care. Why is that but it like, in other cases, it's been like, well, I feel like this is probably for the best because I don't feel like I'm a good fit for this client, or maybe just this family,

Simon Cullen
what sort of things would make you feel like maybe you're not such a good fit, and what would make you feel like you do with the 11 year old, like, you really want to be part of a treatment.

Unknown Speaker
I if I feel like I'm not a good fit, when I can tell that the parents goals are very different from what my goals

Unknown Speaker
are for the child. Um,

Unknown Speaker
and that's also part of what would make make me feel like I'm a really good fit is if the parents schools align with my goals, and that's one part of it. And the other part of feeling like a really good fit is feeling like this client is really challenging. And I don't know that anybody else could really handle him.

Simon Cullen
Okay, so so when you have this, I suppose, difference with the parents? What is it that the parents are focused on that you personally don't focus on yourself?

Unknown Speaker
I'm, like they they may have

Unknown Speaker
the idea that their child should that I should the child should comply with whatever I say, for example, if the child says don't open my backpack, it's got private, that's private, I don't want you opening it. And a parent said, Well, you're, that's, that's not up to her to decide? Well, I think it is up to her to say that.

Unknown Speaker
Or if the parent was really

Unknown Speaker
limiting physical activity for the child, um,

Simon Cullen
could you give me an example of that?

Unknown Speaker
If the child wants to go out and and like, run, um, I can run with a child, I am there, I have never met any client who can run faster than me. So bear with that, but the parents just be too anxious. Okay. And that's disappointing, because I'm being outside and being able to move their bodies is really important. Yeah,

Simon Cullen
I agree. So the first case, maybe it's sort of like, the parents are, and I don't I don't want to put any words into your mouth. So just please tell me if this isn't an accurate summary. But maybe in the first case, the parents have a kind of more authoritarian style, where they really want kids to comply with instructions, even when maybe the kid could, from your perspective legitimately not want to comply?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Never to say no, don't do that. That's private, I thought lifelong skill. You don't like that's something that you're going to need to be able to do. They're not going to be child forever. Going to need to be able to do that later on in life. And so teaching the opposite of that or even breaking that.

Unknown Speaker
I don't agree with that.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, especially being able to tell other people that something is private and to have limits that seems very, potentially very important. Okay, so do you think that any treatments besides ABA should be considered for autistic kids for example, occupational therapy or speech therapy,

Unknown Speaker
things like that? Yes,

Unknown Speaker
I'm all my clients, they. So we work at a clinic where we have the ABA therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists.

Unknown Speaker
music therapists,

Unknown Speaker
we all work in the same building. And with a and we have our neurologists in the building too. We used to have neurofeedback, but I do know, somebody decided that that they didn't want to keep doing that.

Simon Cullen
What was that using? Like a EEG or what what do you mean by neuro?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, was yeah, it was like using EEG to

Unknown Speaker
understand, for the client to

Unknown Speaker
basically visualize the control that they can have over their own body. I mean, I've never actually seen it. So this is just my understanding. It's like, if you take, for example, like if you take deep breaths, and you can watch like your heart rate, for sure. Breathing normalize? Yeah.

Simon Cullen
No, I've definitely heard about using that kind of feedback, to train all sorts of stuff. So that's really interesting. So do you ever talk with the client's parents or caregivers?

Unknown Speaker
Yes.

Simon Cullen
Okay. What kinds of things do you discuss with the parents?

Unknown Speaker
I'm just pretty much everything to do with the kid and sometimes with things that the parents are dealing

Unknown Speaker
with. So

Simon Cullen
trying to help the parents in their efforts to kind of continue helping their kids at home. Yeah. So would it be fair to describe that is kind of providing the parents with some support?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, definitely. Okay, great. That sounds really important. Yeah, it is. That?

Simon Cullen
So what does your clinic do to make sure parents are involved and understand, I know you are helping, but what does the clinic and the BCA be do to ensure that the parents are really involved and understand what's going on with

Unknown Speaker
kids? Well, we

Unknown Speaker
could really, I feel like we could really do more there. But um, I assume some of the supervisors do schedule Parent Training meetings, and one of my supervisors put me in charge of implementing some parent training goals, which is great. We have partner and care stickers, if parents want to come back and participate in their session, and I do it, when it's possible for me to do that I do invite parents to participate at times when I think it would be particularly helpful for in clinic sessions. Um, and I have another BCBA, who she provides weekly parent training every day she meets with the parents and the client, and she is doing parent training.

Unknown Speaker
Um, I wish that like we did

Unknown Speaker
more, though still, even though that we have some really great things going on with that.

Simon Cullen
What do you think the risks are of not having a proper and deep engagement with the parents?

Unknown Speaker
Well, the parents will not

Unknown Speaker
be as engaged with the ABA as such, for parents like that, it might feel like ABA is really just a substitute for school or daycare.

Unknown Speaker
And the parent,

Unknown Speaker
the parent is not being empowered to continue caring for the child throughout that child's existence.

Simon Cullen
Have you ever found cases where parents sort of learn some of the techniques that are used in ABA like say dTT, or ABC training and then apply it in a way that you wouldn't?

Unknown Speaker
Know? Okay, that's good.

Unknown Speaker
Basic. I mean, they do struggle, they struggle with things like focusing on like differential enforcement of like, ignoring negative behaviors and celebrating, celebrating the desirable behaviors. But I think it's more of just like, it's just the struggle that

Unknown Speaker
people in general have?

Simon Cullen
Sure. Well, I'm going to loop back to something you said earlier. So one thing we've definitely heard RBTs wonder about is whether their clients really understand the functions of the behaviors that they're being taught. And one sign we've heard a lot about that a client hasn't deeply understood the point of a behavior is that the client will only perform the behavior in very, very specific circumstances. Like one person told me about a client who would learn to sit at the table where they work with the therapist that had no idea about sitting at the table where they eat lunch. Do you ever feel like clients don't understand the purpose of the behaviors that they're learning? Well, if

Unknown Speaker
they do then that's steeply troubling I try actually not to teach behaviors unless I can provide an explanation for why it's important. Okay, so because sometimes it's super cultural, like, why something is important, and it's really hard to explain. It can be really hard to explain, like, why can't you just run around naked as a tenure? Boy? Well, because when you're no longer when you get older people will get, you'll get in trouble for doing that, because people don't like that. And I want you to get in trouble. So having explanations like that, is really important. Like, kind of like what I wanted from my BCBA. Back at the beginning, when I asked, Well, why do I have to implement this? Rachel? She could have said, well, it's important because it will, it'll help him see like, the his goals for the day, and he'll feel a sense of accomplishment, or something like that, even if it wasn't accurate, rather than just being like, oh, it's always good to have that. I would. Why is it always good?

Simon Cullen
Right. So would you say? So when you're personally working with clients, for you, it sounds like their ability to generalize into different circumstances is extremely important to you? Would you say the

Unknown Speaker
same thing?

Unknown Speaker
And that's why they need to understand why they're learning certain things.

Simon Cullen
Absolutely. Do you feel like that? That very important point you just made is adequately recognized by other RBTs? And, and even BCBAs? No, I

Unknown Speaker
don't do not think that because I think that, like I said, there's just kind of some assumptions. Like, it's assumed that it's always good to listen to what an adult says, well, it's not.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. So what percentage of clients going through the client? The clinic includes not just yours, your clients? But would you have that sort of concern about?

Unknown Speaker
Um,

Unknown Speaker
I would have that concern about any client. That's not my client.

Simon Cullen
Oh, really? Wow. Okay. So, I mean, I can I guess I can say, at this point in the interview, certainly seems like you're, in some ways, thinking much, much more deeply about this therapy than a lot of people that I've talked to, is that your experience as well, like when you talk to others in the field, that sometimes you feel like you're thinking far more deeply than they are?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, yeah.

Simon Cullen
Yeah. Okay, well, let's, let's move on. I mean, maybe I could just, I'm curious, this isn't in the script, or anything. But I'm just curious, you know, to what extent do you feel like that not focusing on the understanding of the function of the behavior is really just a very natural and expected consequence of a therapy, which is really just focused on the eliciting circumstances, the environment, and then the behavior that follows from the environment, and then the consequences of the behavior? You know, when I look at that, I sort of think, and I think a lot of people do, wait, there's something missing from that chain in between the environment and the behavior is a person with a mind who can understand Do you think that by ABA, you know, having its roots in behavioral science? Do you think that that could perhaps explain why there isn't white? Why you perceive this problem with like you said, nearly all clients who aren't yours? Um,

Unknown Speaker
I think that's part of it. And I think another part of it is, is just the culture of like adult autism. And also ableist.

Simon Cullen
Talk, please talk to me about both of those points. So that adult ism and ableism

Unknown Speaker
Well, children's rights culturally, are in their right to self determination and to understand what's going around them on around them and their right to bodily autonomy is not valued in our culture on the same level as it is for adults.

Simon Cullen
Right, right. Yes.

Unknown Speaker
And then

Unknown Speaker
the ablest sort of assumptions are that like it's something to celebrate. If you if somebody can't tell you are autistic.

Unknown Speaker
Mm hmm.

Unknown Speaker
And that, like and I think like some of the ableism is also like related to conformity, like if somebody's acting really different, like if they're flapping their hands, but that's it's not we don't think about well, why Wait, why? Why do we have to why do we care about that? Or why do we care? If somebody's not making eye contact? What difference does it make? Because people will automatically assume well, that's that's, that's different from what we usually see. It draws the eye and then assume that it's bad, or it's something that needs to be corrected just because it's different. And that happens, like even kind of subconsciously.

Unknown Speaker
those assumptions.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, I agree with you. So one, just moving to the next question. So one interesting thing we've certainly heard from RBT is is that in some situations that RBT should or is instructed to ignore maladaptive behaviors, and this is called planned ignoring. Do you use planned ignoring in your own

Unknown Speaker
treatment? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
I did in the beginning, in the beginning, I feel very sad, like, in the way that I did that, and that I was ignoring somebody who was in distress, because I was told that was the best thing to do.

Unknown Speaker
Now, um, I will provide

Unknown Speaker
some form of, like, say, somebody's asking me the same question over and over again. I might like provide, rather than ignoring the question,

Unknown Speaker
I might provide, like a model

Unknown Speaker
of a different, similar question that they could ask. Like, if they're asking me Oh, is my friend coming to OT today? Is my friend coming to tea? today? I would say, Well, what games you want to play with your friend at ot today? Or maybe might practice some things that we could say to our friend or OT? Um, and questions we could ask to get to know her? Um, or like, if if somebody? If somebody's screaming and crying, then I'm gonna find out what they need? Do they need space? Do they need to stay in a room and not? Have anybody talked to them? Or touch them? Or maybe they need? They need like a hug? Or they need some arm squeezes or something to support them? Um, no. So it's not planned. I don't do planned ignoring. Um, I might give less attention to some things that I don't want to encourage. With attention, but

Unknown Speaker
don't just

Unknown Speaker
do ignoring.

Simon Cullen
Okay, yeah. Well, it sounds like you have had actually some, like a moral reaction when you saw what that technique involved. Yet that technique has, from what I've found speaking to lots of RBTs is a very, very common, so maybe you could talk to me, almost like you're, you're still at the beginning of the of your experience of being and RBT, where you're really being instructed to do that. And back then, I know now, you might, I think you specifically said it would not be ignoring, but if someone's asking the same question over and over again, today, these days, you would try and substitute your tray and put it whatever you would do wouldn't involve simply ignoring. But let's think back to before you came to this moral conclusion, that ignoring was not the right thing to do. What back then were you instructed to use ignoring for?

Unknown Speaker
I'm for like, protesting

Unknown Speaker
or like singing like, I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, like getting stuck on something or, or like my, my kid that I worked with, then like, maybe he he, Oh, he didn't like it. When somebody said that he seemed agitated one day. Somebody said, Oh, you seem agitated. And he said, I'm not agitated. I'm not agitated, I'm not agitated. And we're just going to have to ignore that. Ignoring because if we give any attention to it, it'll teach them that. It's not what I guess we thought it I guess I was taught that it would teach them

Unknown Speaker
to continue to

Unknown Speaker
shows that they are in distress, or fixate on a topic. Any fixating maybe like to help them stop fixating on the topic. But now I understand that that. So my understanding then, was that oh, this will help them stop fixating on the topic because every time like, I'll give them attention, then then it'll reset

Unknown Speaker
their fixation.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just I realized the time Are you okay to give us I know, I've actually used our time. But are you okay to give me another 10 minutes? You've just been so interesting and thinking deeply that I've been just asked few more questions. Is that Is that alright? If you've got another 10 as much

Unknown Speaker
I don't have anything going on, you can have as much time as you. Really, really,

Simon Cullen
thank you so much. So thinking back to that period where you were using ignoring as instructed to a variety of behaviors, what sort of reactions Did you observe in the clients when they were being ignored?

Unknown Speaker
escalation, they would become more frantic. They would basically become, they would just basically exhaust themselves.

Unknown Speaker
Mm hmm.

Simon Cullen
Right. That's interesting. So, in a way, I've heard a lot of people said, describe that as they would come down. But you would perhaps think that might not be an accurate description. They're not coming down. They're just getting exhausted. Is that? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker
Which I think it leads to learn helplessness.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Interesting. Okay, yeah, I feel

Simon Cullen
learned helplessness, and concerns about the effects of on motivation, intrinsic motivation would be something I would also want to think a lot about. So do they say that so you would say they begin to seem quite frustrated? Do they ever have tantrums when? As a result of being ignored back then? Yeah. Okay, so, again, thinking back then, what did the BCBA instruct you? You know, what did the BCBA say? If the student if the client does behavior x, then you should return your intention to the client. I presume behavior X would include severe self harming behaviors, you shouldn't ignore those? Or perhaps not, but what were the sorts of things that a child could have done to get you to return your attention to the client?

Unknown Speaker
I don't think I was ever told what I'm

Unknown Speaker
like, in what scenario I should return my attention.

Simon Cullen
So that was just left up to your judgment.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. I

Unknown Speaker
basically, oh, well, I was told I returned my attention when stay calm

Simon Cullen
once they're calm, okay. I see why you ended up reflecting quite a lot on your experience here. So all right. So imagine I started want to ask you, I want to ask you every question. But I want to ask you about both when you were starting out, because that's such an important period for RBTs. But I also want to ask you now that you've had all of this experience and reflections on so that's, I'm sorry, why I'm going so slowly. So yeah, thinking back to when you were when you're, you know, your first year, imagine you're using a dTT approach, trying to get a kid to ask for a toy using its name, maybe truck or train thinking of a typical client back then, how long will you make the client work before giving them time to rest?

Unknown Speaker
Um, well,

Unknown Speaker
I've never really used dTT as such, but for like, a task, like activities like that

Simon Cullen
any repetitive kind of training even?

Unknown Speaker
I would, I would. Well, I'm thinking more

Unknown Speaker
of like, this social learning, language, social learning. textbook that I would use, it shows a picture, like an illustration of some social scenario, and then it has some questions for you to ask your client and discuss with them. And that was the thing that he really hated doing. He really hated doing that. Um, I would try to do the whole thing with him.

Unknown Speaker
But we would kind of I would end up like setting

Unknown Speaker
a timer and figuring out like, how long he was willing to do it for or maybe we would do it like near the end of session. And it would be like, Oh, time run out, like we're done. I've actually my head and I have another client that I currently seen, who also didn't like that curriculum. And it's probably the way that I was presenting it, there was probably a way that I could present it to make it more fun and engaging.

Unknown Speaker
But it wasn't,

Unknown Speaker
I was not presenting it in a way that was made it fun and engaging. So

Unknown Speaker
yeah, so

Simon Cullen
thinking back to that timer, how many minutes could you get the child to work? And again, thinking back to when you were sort of stuck Adding out isn't happy tea? Would you? Would you have the child work continuously without letting them take a break? No,

Unknown Speaker
no, no, no. Like I might say like, if it's something really non prefer if it's I might probably said things like, we'll have it will be done in five minutes or do you want to be done in 10 minutes or five minutes? And then set a timer and then we'd be done.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, yeah.

Simon Cullen
Okay. Can I ask what you've observed with other RBTs? In your time working in ABA?

Unknown Speaker
Um, they usually, I don't think there is.

Unknown Speaker
They seem to push it like a little bit more, but they have pretty short activities that are very nonpreferred like matching activities. And it's like, Okay, we're gonna match five things. And it will take less than five minutes, really? And be like, Okay, then we'll be done with this. And we won't have to do it anymore. And I think that's fine. But I also think it's kind of sad that it's like, Well, why do we even have to do it to begin with?

Simon Cullen
Yes, so the matching do you mean, like, same shape? Same color, that kind of

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, matching? Uh, huh. Yeah,

Simon Cullen
good question. So when your kids are taking breaks, and maybe I can ask you to sort of answer about, again, this sort of when you were starting out? How much time do you give them just to be completely self directed, not not, not responding to the therapist in any way.

Unknown Speaker
Um, I if when

Unknown Speaker
sessions that I'm on my own, I would give them as much time as possible, like, because that those are the intervals when we would actually have interactions, and we would get to know each other. Because without any demand being placed, the client will ask me questions, they'll say things, they'll talk about something that happened at school, they'll if they have echolalia, they will be echoing things that have been said to them, or that they've heard or that they're thinking about, that time is super valuable to therapy?

Unknown Speaker
Um, I,

Simon Cullen
I don't mean to interrupt, but I'm just so struck by what you just said, because I don't think I've ever heard anyone else say that during that time when the child is, as it were just hanging out, you know, you're not, they're not responding to any kind of demand, that that's when you actually get to know them. And presumably, you build rapport? Was that something you were instructed to do by, you know, education from the PCAOB? Or is that just something that you do?

Unknown Speaker
yourself?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, that's just something I prefer to do. I'm very comfortable with it. I've noticed that other RBTs when they are assistant supervisors who I've had a couple of new assistant supervisors, and they can get a little bit uncomfortable in my sessions, because they feel like there isn't enough structure like we're not playing a board game. We're not doing this. We're not doing that.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Interesting. So

Simon Cullen
yeah, I would I hope to hear about more people who are doing what you have discovered, maybe then we can report that and more people will start doing it again.

Unknown Speaker
Well, it would be really great. If that could be like, if it could be understood that that is a part of therapy, because I think, what what oh, well, when I was starting out, my BCBA told me because she noticed that I would have those long intervals of self directed interaction between me and the client. And she would say this is an intensive therapy, and we're building experience for intensive therapy. So it's got to look like intensive therapy.

Unknown Speaker
Wow. Um,

Unknown Speaker
so it would be great if there was more respect for that type of interaction as a form of therapy.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Well, again, sticking back in that that early period where you were working. When you were working with a client, what would be the most common signs back then that they were getting really frustrated?

Unknown Speaker
The pitch of their voice or anything else and the rate of their speech

Unknown Speaker
you want to add anything

Simon Cullen
to that list of voice and speech writers is the best answer.

Unknown Speaker
Well, I I work with I work with only

Unknown Speaker
one client. Um, back when I was starting I work and then on weekends, I work with some clients in group contexts. But,

Unknown Speaker
um,

Unknown Speaker
it was pretty clear, it's pretty clear when they with the clients that I work with starting out, when they were frustrated I've worked with I now work with clients who have some more who can be much more subtle,

Unknown Speaker
but they would

Unknown Speaker
like a crying like a frantic whiny tone of voice. Um, I don't even I don't want to say like, I don't want to say like muscle rigidity, or jumping up and down or like rigid facial expressions, because that was also associated with like, just excitement. So it was that was just a general sign of like, an elevated state of arousal. But the the pleading, like, high pitched tone of voice and repeating, like requests,

Unknown Speaker
and saying no, like, if

Unknown Speaker
I didn't want to do this, like, that was the sign.

Simon Cullen
Okay. And again, sticking back there in this early period. Imagine a child is now you know, starting to speak faster, maybe crying and using that pleading tone of voice, I don't want to do this. How long do you persist? Not Not today. But back then how long do you persist before giving them a rest? Um,

Unknown Speaker
I would keep trying to modify unless it moved into the point where they're just over there having a tantrum on their own, and I'm doing planned ignoring, I would keep trying to modify the task and encourage them until they could maybe do it in just because in some aspect, like,

Unknown Speaker
um,

Unknown Speaker
I would do like, it was mostly like, I would modify, I would provide encouragement and modify the tasks. Like if it's trying to new food, that was a big thing, because I had a client who was really afraid of trying certain foods, he had pretty strong food aversions, I would be like, you can you can try it, and you can just spit it out.

Unknown Speaker
Yes. Okay, I really like

Unknown Speaker
now, that might with my understanding of feeding therapy, I just think that like, my approach to encouraging the client to try new foods was not the best.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Who do you blame for that? Um, I just had no.

Unknown Speaker
I had thought a few I blamed for it, I think

Unknown Speaker
I had I understood that

Unknown Speaker
you should never like for somebody to eat something like for somebody to put something in their mouth.

Unknown Speaker
But I think I would blame

Unknown Speaker
myself for like conflating, like, food aversions with different kinds of OCD versions, and like the idea of exposure therapy like that, it's good to try it in some way. And that will help the fear. The fear and the exposure therapy type things did work with other fears, but not with food. And

Simon Cullen
it's interesting that you would blame yourself, because when you were starting out, I think you said the BCBA gives you 40 hours. The B ACB. Goodness, all the letters the BAC be

Unknown Speaker
like, why did we don't get?

Simon Cullen
Yes, so the ACB has given you 40 hours of instruction and, or some kind of education and then you're working with the BCBA. But they might not be fully supporting you. And so you might think that the blame is actually more of a structural thing to do with ABA itself and the way RBTs are trained and the degree of support that they receive. Perhaps also, yeah, sorry, please.

Unknown Speaker
That's a good that's a good point. And I think like you just like nobody tells BCBAs or RBTs like the risks of harm in ABA, like this, basically don't talk about all the ways that ABA can like things you do an ABA could harm somebody for the rest of their lives. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
yeah.

Simon Cullen
Okay, um, so at the current clinic where you work having Three times a day, would you observe a client having a tantrum when they're working with a RBT? Or a BCBA? Is it a common type of

Unknown Speaker
occurrence at least once at least once? Okay.

Simon Cullen
And that's like a full full on meltdown, tantrum?

Unknown Speaker
Well, it depends on how like they like for that client, like the tantrum is operationally defined, but what I'm seeing is just screaming and being on the floor,

Simon Cullen
screaming and would you call that flipping?

Unknown Speaker
No, I mean, sometimes there's flopping but mostly, it's just like the screaming protesting

Unknown Speaker
that because

Unknown Speaker
there have there are there have been clients who flop.

Unknown Speaker
But screaming is the most common.

Unknown Speaker
I mean, and like not like sitting sitting on the floor and not transitioning to the next activity.

Simon Cullen
Yeah. Well, I think I know how you're going to answer this next question. So I'll I'll ask it anyway, and then maybe I can rephrase it. So ABA, many people think is showing very convincingly that rewards and positive reinforcement play an important and legitimate role in shaping behavior. But at the same time, almost all societies also leave a place for the use of aversives to shape behavior. I certainly remember my mom would give me a snack if I was sufficiently naughty for her. So generally, what role do aversives play in the treatment provided at your clinic? We don't

Unknown Speaker
ever use aversive sets such as, sometimes it might be a natural consequence. Like, for example, if my 14 year old says, calls me like an idiot, I'm like, Well, I think I want to take a break from hanging out with you for a second because I don't really like spending time with people who call me names. But then, it seems like my engagement with her is very reinforcing. That's, um, that could be kind of aversive that I'm disengaging from the interaction. But I feel that's a natural consequence. That would happen, any relationship? Um, okay. Or maybe some, like, if my 10 year old is

Unknown Speaker
he hit

Unknown Speaker
on more than once I've told him to follow some safety instruction. And I've given maybe I've given him three chances, and he's still not able to follow it. And we're going to be done with that activity, even if it's a really rewarding activity, because it's not going to be safe.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, what about? Sorry,

Simon Cullen
I was gonna ask, what what have you observed other people doing? Who, you know, who might have different approach a different approach to you? Have you seen the use of aversive as being? How have you seen it versus being used? If at all, not, not just the natural consequences? But say the introduction of something the child doesn't want?

Unknown Speaker
Well, I don't

Unknown Speaker
think I see that a whole lot.

Unknown Speaker
I mean, I guess something I

Unknown Speaker
do notice with newer RBTs is, um, oh, you're not going to get to be able to do this, or like, you didn't do this. So now you don't get this like you don't you you're not going to get a Pokemon card. If you don't sit down for circle time, or like, Oh, you didn't sit down for circle time, like after the fact like, you did this? You did that. So now you're not going to get this? That's the type of thing

Unknown Speaker
I would see. How do you feel about that?

Unknown Speaker
Um, well, I'd like to BCBA I let the BCBA know that I think like this, these PI's need some more support. And he kind of told me about how they were working. They were working on implementing he agreed with me, and they were working on implementing feedback. And using behavioral making better use of behavioral strat positive reinforcement strategies, and, but that it can be really difficult for bas to, to implement that, especially like he said, it can be really hard for VIPs to stop like telling their client every single thing that the client is doing wrong. Yeah. And maybe it has to do with how those individual like, adults were parented when they were children. Yeah, yeah. Like they have to unlearn that. Yeah, I

Simon Cullen
imagine that that will take time for them as well as well. So thinking about all was the clients at your clinic? How often would you say that blocking physical blocking is used?

Unknown Speaker
Well, that is now almost like, not when I started out at this clinic a few years ago, it was happening a lot. It was you we were even instructed to do it,

Simon Cullen
would you say that it was happening every day or every other day? Yeah, every day, I would see

Unknown Speaker
it, I would be instructed to do it.

Unknown Speaker
Now, and I don't like I have, like, complained about

Unknown Speaker
certain things that, um, I would see, to human resources to other like members of executive leadership.

Unknown Speaker
And, and so now, I don't know how

Unknown Speaker
much of it is related to my specific complaints or just like trends in the field. But we now do not block clients with our bodies

Unknown Speaker
unless it's like you're really trying to stop somebody from running into the street.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
but there's more focus on environmental arrangement to avoid like, having to do that in the first place.

Simon Cullen
That sounds like a great idea. Thinking back to the period where it was used, basically, you know, very often, what sort of circumstances in what circumstances would blocking be used and how was it done.

Unknown Speaker
It was usually to prevent the was like the person would, the BI would like shuffle quickly shuffle in front, or leap in front of the child. And to keep them within the instructional area not to go into like another room for example, the OT room or like the chart room or the music room or to go out the door mostly like to keep them out of areas they weren't really supposed to be in

Unknown Speaker
and

Simon Cullen
what is the approach today to try to do that?

Unknown Speaker
Um, now

Unknown Speaker
it's more so we put up we put up Visual blocks we closed like we closed more doors, we we are more relaxed about oh, the clients going into the chart room. Okay, well, what's going on in here, like check it out. Like it's not a seclusion, like, we don't have locks on the inside doors.

Unknown Speaker
So

Unknown Speaker
we can work with that environment. I think sometimes. I think when I started, it felt really anxiety provoking because it's like, oh, my clients running in here and disturbing these people disturbing them serving this. And now I'm kind of like, well, my job is not like there's all these cool rooms inside this building. We don't box on it, because we're not being a seclusion. Environment. Yeah. And, and, okay, you want to go in here, then. Let's, we'll, we'll go in here for a little bit. And then we'll, I might have something on I like to have something on hand that can help us to transition like bubbles, or some productivity sometimes, I'll even collaborate with my client if like, oh, with my three year old, she goes into the music room. I'll ask her well, do you want to do piano or bubbles? Piano? Or what would you want to do piano or go outside, outside and find out what she wants to do more than be in this room, because I do feel that I shouldn't let her be playing with the musical instruments.

Unknown Speaker
If I really even though it

Unknown Speaker
is really fun, and obviously she's, it's perfectly normal for her to want to go in there. If I do let her go into these rooms consistently. Then one day, she's gonna go in when interrupt somebody's therapy session, and she's gonna have to get the door shut interface. So okay, we're kind of a little bit more chilled with clients going into different rooms. And I try to model that too, because I know newbies can get really anxious when they feel like they have to control their client. Yeah,

Simon Cullen
yeah, I mean, generally are you satisfied with the way new API's are getting inducted into the clinic or do you feel like there's really room to make that much better?

Unknown Speaker
Um, I yeah, I actually think new API's

Unknown Speaker
are I've given some feedback to our learning and development team on some things that it Seems like the BAS don't know.

Unknown Speaker
Um, and but overall, I think that they,

Unknown Speaker
they're the way that newbies are inductive has actually improved since I was hired. They breed on they revamped, like their whole onboarding experience. And I think it's actually better now. Okay,

Simon Cullen
that's good. Well, the next question is about restraint. So if you could think of all of the clinics that you have experience with, How often would you say a physical restraint was used,

Unknown Speaker
not just blocking? Um, well,

Unknown Speaker
at the other clinic, I worked out when I was starting out.

Unknown Speaker
You were told to

Unknown Speaker
you were told, Well, maybe it's not the same as restraint. But you were told to like hand over hand, prompt your do the movements, like with the circle time song? Yeah. Which I really did not like that. Physically controlling. I was told to do it. And I was like, Well, I have to do it, because I'm told to do it. But at least I had to be told to do it to do it. So I would see that every Saturday would see that. And to me, that's a form of restraint, because you're not the person who's not free to move their hands or keep their hands still as they would prefer. And then as for the clinic, I met now I've been at two clinics. Um, so this, the one I'm at currently is the second one. I do not, I can put complained about it. When I saw it. When my BCBA would hold down my bench, she was two, two at that time, she would actually hold her down in the chair, until she said, All done. So when transitioning from a seated activity to another activity, he would hold her down in the chair until she said, done, and sometimes the BCBA sorry, go ahead.

Simon Cullen
Sorry, did you say this is a two year old child? Hmm. Okay, I sorry, I just wanted to make sure I had that. Right. Please continue.

Unknown Speaker
And so the terrible thing was that

Unknown Speaker
sometimes the child would say all done, but since the BCBA, wasn't spending that much time with the child, she didn't stand the child's words as well. Notice with little kids, they you get to know like the way that they talk and understand their better over time. So the child sometimes would say all done in the BCBA wouldn't fear, the child would have to say all done multiple times to be able to be released. And, or the child might say, No, the child would be crying and screaming during this whole thing. And to any sane person, it would be evident. That all done. Yeah. And that he's saying no. Um, I think this is one of the reasons why the other BI on the case last, maybe. But so I complained about that. I made a big deal out, complained about it to multiple people, it said that I wouldn't, I wasn't going to do that I was being instructed to do use techniques that I did not agree with and that were morally wrong.

Unknown Speaker
And I was kind of just, I was kind of like

Unknown Speaker
the HR or HR person who I talked to, like, she agreed with me and everything. But then in the end, what she proposed was that I get a medical accommodation. In order not to restrain the children, you're going

Simon Cullen
to have permission to not use restraint, you should get some kind of medical exemption. Is that am I understanding that?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, so she wrote, she sent me the Form for Requesting a medical accommodation.

Unknown Speaker
That's very strange. I was just like,

Unknown Speaker
I think because I talked about, um, because because I am autistic. I was diagnosed when I was four years old, and I have been restrained. I have been like, experienced that use of force. And so I guess it was decided that this was a medical issue specific to me, because I was being re traumatized. Maybe. Wow. Rather than admitting that this is wrong.

Unknown Speaker
I mean, it's a very,

Simon Cullen
it's very hard for me to understand. I mean, maybe this is the sort of thing that can only happen in an HR department but wouldn't recognizing that it was a medical issue for you to imply that it is still wrong, because here you have a person in front of you, who experienced this as a child and has concluded as an adult, that they will not ever participate in it. And the response of HR is to say, well, you should get an exemption, not to.

Unknown Speaker
But when that happened, I kind of just gave up, I was like, You know what, the supervisor hardly ever comes out. And I'm just, I'm not going to do I'm going to do whatever I can to avoid having to do this. I just, I just won't do it. She can do like, if she does it. I don't know what, it's good. I don't know. Like, I'll try to get her to stop. And then in my review, my, my direct supervisor told me that one of the things I needed to work on was doing what's right, even when it's hard, as in restraining, using physical prompting, and restraining the child, because, you know, it's to keep them safe. But no, it's not, I'm aware of, I'm aware of when a child is in danger. And when a child is not in danger.

Unknown Speaker
And it's nuts. It was just really silly.

Unknown Speaker
And then, so I, when my supervisor was out, I would try to be a little bit more hands on. So she wouldn't, she wouldn't get frustrated with me, I was feeling a lot of pressure to comply with the supervisor. And so one day, we were in our in our pre K program, and the director of the pre K program was out observing. And I picked my client up to transition her help her transition to the restroom, was easier than just like it was would be because that's what I was expected to do. And my direct supervisor then came running after me, she was also in the room. And she was she was the lead of the pre K program and the director, that was her boss, she came in, she said, Mark, oh, Marcus, Marcus said, to not pick the children up to transition them, let them transition on their own. And I was like, Well, that's what I would prefer to do. But I'm doing what my case supervisor told me to do. And, and then so then my direct supervisor, my case supervisor talked to me about it later. And he's they were like, well, just, you know, Marcus isn't usually here. He's doesn't work with this client, and just take what he says with a grain of salt. Like, I don't think you need to listen to him. Wow. And then later, I was reviewing, I was reviewing our, our pre K, like the checklist for pre K program, and I saw that Marcus has had

Unknown Speaker
added Do not ever pick up a child, or

Unknown Speaker
or physically prompt them without gaining their scent

Unknown Speaker
first. And

Unknown Speaker
I was like, Wow, that's great. And I sent him a message. And I told him about my whole experience with this client and my supervisors. And he said, Well, he thanked me for the feedback. And he said, we're going to, like, we're working on making this making ABA much more of an ethics first practice. And we I'm gonna let leadership know about this. And

Unknown Speaker
we're gonna like we're going

Unknown Speaker
to, we're going to just the training so that people understand, like, how to respect bodily autonomy of the children. Um, and so that was really great. And after that was when things started to change in respect to physical prompting, and blocking and that sort of restraint thing.

Simon Cullen
Do you think that if you hadn't, haven't gone to HR talk to the supervisor made all of these efforts? Do you think things would have changed

Unknown Speaker
anyhow? Um, I think they would.

Unknown Speaker
Because I think Mark is I think that at least in the prep program,

Unknown Speaker
I certainly hope that they would have Yeah, I

Unknown Speaker
but I don't know. I know that Marcus was kind of thinking along the same lines as me, which is good, but he specifically works with the specifically involved with prep. So now, with all the clients, I noticed people, people are more mindful of of the way that they're prompting the clients. Yeah, I mean, that physical prompting is like the best biggest issue with the small children? Because it's really just easiest. It's easier to physically prompt them. It's, it's easier than anything else. If you want if your goal is to have a quick compliance.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Do you,

Simon Cullen
you know, thinking about the structure of ABA, the scientific views that it's based on, and then also the structure of the institutions? Do you think there's anything in there, which makes it particularly liable to

Unknown Speaker
lead to these kinds of problems? Yeah, I do. And I'm not like, I'm not even sure. I'm not even sure exactly. Well, you know, yeah, I think because it's all run by neurotypical people. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
I think it is, that's a big reason, maybe why?

Unknown Speaker
It's liable to.

Unknown Speaker
Because you won't have any clinicians who have had those experiences themselves, and to understand what

Unknown Speaker
it is what it is to be autistic, and benefit

Unknown Speaker
or not benefit from therapy, and the impact that has on you over your lifetime?

Unknown Speaker
Yeah. Yeah.

Simon Cullen
I also wonder, you know, from talking, especially to people in, you know, associated with sort of ABA advocacy organizations that I sort of wonder if maybe, first of all, you know, I've asked them questions like, well, here are the sorts of criticisms that have been made. And the most common replies, Well, those were made by autistic people who lack theory of mind. Not making it up. And, you know, it's kind of interesting. So there's this disbelief, that the people who are being treated perhaps will grow up and lack the ability to interpret social cues. And somehow that is relevant to their criticism. But I feel like maybe I'm curious what your reaction is, you know, because the theory that it comes from, of course, is really behaviorism. Right? It's focused on features of the eliciting situation. And then it wants to understand the relationship, as it says, a law like relationship between features of the situation, and the behavior. But there's a sub there's something in between the feet, the situation and the behavior, and that is a child or a person or a mind, a thing which feels and understands and can be confused. And that seems like it's systematically left out of this whole worldview, because actually, that's exactly what early 20th century psychologists were trying to do. They were trying to prove psychology as a respectable science, just like physics, because we know, I tried to focus on mental states, which are unobservable, were just about behavior. Do you do do you have any reactions or feelings about that? Well,

Unknown Speaker
I from the very beginning, when I started, I knew that a BA in psychology in general is very sensitive about, like, how they measure up to, quote unquote, real science and showing that they are real science, because science, as it's done in physics, and chemistry is apparently the gold standard, like the highest of what you can achieve.

Unknown Speaker
And

Unknown Speaker
I always thought, well, it's not a real science, whatever they say. Like it's just not because there's too many variables that aren't controlled. And my view on that has kind of evolved at this point,

Unknown Speaker
to the

Unknown Speaker
exaltation of something being scientific, as, like, conflating that, with it being good and inherently valuable is a real problem. Because science has done like we've very scientifically done some really awful things.

Unknown Speaker
Well put, hey, that's very well put.

Simon Cullen
Okay, I'm gonna move on to the last questions here. So these are about particularly controversy surrounding the treatment and Yes, while working on this project, myself and also other members of the research team have certainly noticed that there are critical perspectives around the therapy. And indeed, I think you have expressed quite a few of them. But in your career, have you heard about the controversies coming from elsewhere? Like people at your work or on the internet or from family members or friends or anything like that?

Unknown Speaker
Um, I haven't heard them coming from coming from

Unknown Speaker
peep colleagues. I haven't heard it from Holly Well, except for like a, like, one of the OT therapists. She was like, Well, what is what is ABA? Isn't it just like glorified babysitting? And I was like, no, no, we're actually doing things.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, definitely. Um,

Unknown Speaker
and so that's one type of critique, I counted. But other than that, nothing within the workplace. Some parents have mentioned that they come into contact with anti ABA people. And they advocate for like, well, our ABA isn't like what you're describing, and like, what you're describing is something people were doing it wrong.

Unknown Speaker
Mmm hmm. Family members. I don't think

Unknown Speaker
like my family members, my family members are pretty like overall pretty distrustful of like institutions like the school system, the medical system, so they probably

Unknown Speaker
kind of they if

Unknown Speaker
they would probably be distrustful, if they had more encounters with ABA as such,

Unknown Speaker
they will probably be distrustful of it.

Unknown Speaker
But they don't have any specific critiques. But I've read, I've read things online. And I understand that there's like a lack of nuance. But I do think it's important for people to be aware that even if they're making blanket, blanket statements that don't apply to every like practitioner, every individual instance of ABA therapy being delivered, I think it's really important for people to be aware of the harm that ABA Can,

Unknown Speaker
can cause.

Unknown Speaker
Because on the other side of it, nobody's talking about that arm at all. And it's automatically you get referred for ABA, and it's the most evidence based, highest standard of treatment, when a kid is diagnosed with autism.

Simon Cullen
You know, I'm kind of the I've heard this is very common, when autistic kids who received the therapy, as children grow up, and many have now become autistic self advocates, and they certainly do, reflect and often feel very feel like they really were harmed. And yes, exactly what you said, is the reply to them. Oh, well, that's due to, you know, just a few bad apples who aren't doing the therapy correctly. And my question to anyone who makes that argument is how do you know how many bad apples there are? Who has actually ever done what we are doing this summer? And what we're trying to do, and really just reach out to people who will talk to us, candidly, so that we can say, Yeah, this is a very, very rare thing. Or we can say actually, this is

Unknown Speaker
troublingly Common? Well, I

Unknown Speaker
can say that I never encountered any research like this in during my master's program with everything that I read. That we are i i got the sense that research in ABA is very homogenous, or has been for a long time in terms of like the perspectives and the kinds of things that were explored. Yeah, absolutely. Assistive because of what ABA is, because it's all about like, oh, is this intervention more effective than that? interventions,

Unknown Speaker
stuff like that? Yeah, I,

Simon Cullen
I've been reading some of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis and it really is article after article about how to manipulate different behaviors, and that's pretty much the focus. Okay, well, I'm just starting to see if we've talked about so much. I'm just trying to see if there were loose ends I wanted to tie up. I guess, maybe I could just put it to you. Like, is there anything that we haven't talked about that you would like to tell me?

Unknown Speaker
Um, I guess not. I

Unknown Speaker
just I really hope that um, So I can, we can stay in touch so I can follow the trajectory of this research that you're doing.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. I will, I will make sure of it. So in the fall, once we have a report, I will certainly share it with you. And I would I would be delighted then if you would, if you would want to talk to me and give me your reflections on what we found. But let me just thank you so much for all the time you gave me, especially on the weekend. I really do appreciate it a lot. And it's only because people like you are happy to give this time that we're maybe going to be able to paint a little bit more of a picture of what what this therapy is like, for so many autistic kids. So thank you very, very much.

Unknown Speaker
Thank you. It was my pleasure. Thank you for doing that. Thank you for investigating this. And giving, giving voice to all these perspectives.

Simon Cullen
Yeah, absolutely. It's my pleasure. Thank you so much. It was good to meet you. Have a good day.
