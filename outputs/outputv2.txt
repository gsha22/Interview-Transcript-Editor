Interviewer: 
Okay, just to confirm, you're okay with me recording this interview?

RBT: 
Yes. 

Interviewer: 
Thank you. Let's start with some background questions before we delve deeper. In which state are you currently working?

RBT: 
I'm currently working in Jacksonville, Florida.

Interviewer: 
What is the highest level of education you've achieved?

RBT: 
I have my high school diploma and I'm nine classes away from completing my bachelor's in social work. I expect to finish in about a year.

Interviewer: 
I'm interested in discussing that further. But first, how many years have you been working with clients?

RBT: 
I've been working with clients for about a year and a half. I didn't know about the RBT role until 2022. I found the job posting on Indeed and that's how I started. I received most of my training last year.

Interviewer: 
I'm eager to hear about your journey into ABA. Where have you delivered therapy - at home, in a clinic, or at school?

RBT: 
I've conducted one session at a client's home. All other sessions have been at the center.
Interviewer: 
I'm definitely curious about what happened.

RBT: 
I had a client who I absolutely loved. He was one of my favorite clients, very smart. Despite the distance from the center to his home being quite far, I enjoyed the drive because I knew I would have a great time at his house. However, he graduated out of the program and I was left without a client. I wouldn't say that I didn't want another home-based client, but I've become more selective. After him, I decided to stay at the center.

Interviewer: 
I've heard from other RBTs about the challenges of driving around, especially when a client cancels and they lose out on the money for gas without being able to make up the hours. It sounds difficult. Currently, you hold an RBT credential from the BACB. Do you have any plans to become a BCBA?

RBT: 
At the moment, I won't say no because I've met some great BCBAs who have motivated me. However, it's not a definite plan. I'm interested in mental health therapy and adoption counseling. My mind might change next year, so it's a possibility, but not a certainty.
Interviewer: 
I'm curious about your interest in adoption counseling. Could you tell me more about what led you to this field?

RBT: 
I initially wanted to major in psychology before I left high school. I started my college journey at Savannah State, which didn't offer psychology, only social work. After researching, I realized that social work offered many opportunities. During my freshman year, I took a class with a professor named Loach. We watched a Netflix documentary about a young boy, whose name I believe was Banik. We analyzed the film and wrote projects on it. This experience touched me deeply as I knew children growing up who didn't have the best home environments. My goal is to help place these children not just in any home, but in a loving and caring environment. I've seen that some adoptive families aren't always the best option. I strongly believe in giving children the right start in life.
Interviewer: 
That's amazing. It's hard to imagine the immense importance of such a decision. It's wonderful that you're going to make a significant difference in lives. Thank you for answering the background questions. We're very interested in whether RBTs are paid fairly for their work and if they're treated well. Would you mind sharing your starting salary in your first position as an RBT?

RBT: 
I'm quite open about it, actually. I started off earning $16 an hour as an RBT. Initially, I was a behavior tech before I received my credential. After getting my credential, I received a 25 cent raise, so my wage was $16.25. I stayed at this rate for about seven to eight months. Eventually, I voiced my concern about the low pay and was bumped up to $18 an hour. However, the first company I worked for didn't offer enough hours to match the pay, making it difficult to pay bills and a car note. Consequently, I left and now earn $20.50 an hour. Despite the increase, the hours still don't match the pay, making it a bit challenging. But it's definitely a significant difference.
Interviewer: 
Were you receiving health insurance when you were earning $16.25? 

RBT: 
No, I wasn't.

Interviewer: 
Are you currently receiving health insurance from your work?

RBT: 
No, I'm not.

Interviewer: 
How many hours a week would you work in total, considering all of the clients that you're seeing?

RBT: 
With my first company, I was working around 40 to 45 hours every two weeks. Sometimes, it was only 20 to 25 hours. Now, I work about 30 hours a week.

Interviewer: 
How many hours per week would you work with an average client?

RBT: 
With the first company, I worked with one client for about 15 hours a week.

Interviewer: 
What about with your current company?

RBT: 
It's a bit easier now. I work with two children. On Monday and Tuesday, I work with one child, on Wednesday and Thursday, I work with the other, and on Friday, I go back to the first child. So, I work with one child for about 15 hours a week and the other for about 10 hours a week.
Interviewer: 
Okay. Are there other therapists also working with these children? Could they be receiving around 20 to 30 hours of therapy a week? You mentioned having a caseload of four clients at your first job. That seems like a lot. Did that create any challenges? Would you like to discuss that?

RBT: 
Honestly, it was often very draining. Despite having a large caseload, there were many cancellations. Children frequently fell ill, leading to cancellations. It was challenging to start my day with my first two clients, only to have the third one cancel. It was indeed very frustrating. I was emotionally overwhelmed numerous times. However, my deep appreciation for the children made everything better. I stayed at that job for 10 months, primarily because of them. I still regret leaving them to this day.
Interviewer: 
It sounds like you really connect with your kids, especially the first one you spent home time with. That must have been a real challenge. Moving on to a less personal question, could you describe the full course of treatment in an average clinic? From when they start at the clinic to when they graduate, how long does the average treatment program take?

RBT: 
If we're starting from the very beginning, as I have with some kids, we were always taught in training that the maximum duration is three years. I'm not sure what other RBTs were told, but most children are able to meet the standards and reach their goals within that three-year mark. They then graduate and go on to school. However, it also depends on where they start and how old they are. I started with a one and a half year old whose treatment plan was planned out for three years. I also started with a seven year old who completed her program within two months.

Interviewer: 
What did she achieve after two months that made people think she was ready to leave?

RBT: 
She started off with very few words, but by the time I finished working with her, she was making full sentences. She was talking to me as if we were best friends and had known each other for five years. She was a very functional child. The tasks and targets we had set for her were met so quickly that it was clear she didn't need to be here anymore. She needed to be somewhere that could meet her where she was and push her to where she needed to be, because we didn't think we could.
Interviewer: 
That must be a good feeling. You mentioned that you've been there for 10 months, and you only stay that long because of your clients. How many years do RBTs typically stay on in the clinic? We've been hearing a lot about burnout and turnover.

RBT: 
I would say it depends on how dedicated you are to the field. For instance, when I started working with a colleague, she had already been an RBT for five years. Now, a year later, this is her sixth year. She loves it and has no plans to leave, even if she goes back to get her bachelor's degree. She doesn't want to become a BCBA. However, I also know someone who only stayed for six months. So, it really depends on your dedication.

Interviewer: 
Do you have a sense of what's more common? Is it more common to stay for six months or six years?

RBT: 
It's more common to stay for six years. It's very rare that I see someone leave after just a few months.
Interviewer: 
Okay, that's pretty good. So, for an average, would you say I could put down two or three years? 

RBT: 
I would say three. 

Interviewer: 
Okay, cool. So, would you say that the level of staff turnover and burnout is concerning?

RBT: 
Yes, it is. Do you want me to elaborate on that?

Interviewer: 
Yes, please.

RBT: 
At the previous center where I worked, we were understaffed at one point. We managed to increase our staffing a little, but then we lost our center manager. So, we were without a city manager and short-staffed once again. Then we lost the BCBA. We had two BCBAs for over 15 kids and about four RBTs.

Interviewer: 
Wow. 

RBT: 
So, we were struggling, and it was concerning because the kids weren't getting what they needed. I'm always concerned about the kids and their progress. That was the most concerning for me. It always reverts back to the kids, but it was indeed concerning.
Interviewer: 
It's clear that you're most concerned about the kids. I'm sure it was hard for everyone involved. Could you elaborate on the issues you found most concerning with the kids? You mentioned some regression?

RBT: 
Yes, regression was a significant issue. Parents also played a huge role. For instance, I worked with a child who didn't have a morning RBT, and I was his new RBT from 12 to three. His mother was very involved, which I appreciated, but she was constantly emailing and texting about her son's progress. I felt helpless because there was nothing I could do about the morning session. So, the parents' concerns added to the challenges.

RBT: 
In my current job, if a therapist is out, the child can still be in the center. However, about two and a half weeks ago, we were severely understaffed with only two RBTs for seven kids. Most of these children have major behavioral issues. Managing four of them with major behaviors and the other three who were upset by the noise was incredibly stressful. It was probably the most stress I've ever experienced.

Interviewer: 
I can't even imagine.

RBT: 
There were moments when I questioned my career choice. But I stuck it out. However, I felt it was unfair. They shouldn't be overworking me if they're not willing to pay me accordingly.
Interviewer: 
You mentioned there were only two RBTs for seven kids, all with major behaviors such as self-injurious or escape behaviors. Besides the unfairness to the RBTs, I'm also concerned about the kids. We'll delve deeper into this later, but for now, do you feel respected at your current clinic?

RBT: 
Absolutely not. I am certain that I am not respected.

Interviewer: 
How does that manifest?

RBT: 
Well, it's not everyone. I love the parents and the kids, but the management is terrible. Currently, there aren't many options in Jacksonville, so I have to endure my current situation to pay my bills.
Interviewer: 
What sort of problems have you had with management?

RBT: 
When I first started, I was given a heads up about the second BCBA. They told me she hadn't been around for months and wasn't providing supervision. This concerned me because my credentials could be revoked due to lack of supervision. When I met her, she was very standoffish and seemed to favor one RBT over the others. If I approached her with a question, she would dismiss me, which I felt was detrimental to the children we were supposed to be helping. 

I was assigned a child with 76 targets on our program, which was overwhelming. I was expected to run 76 targets 10 trials a day, which seemed impossible. I requested a meeting to discuss my concerns, but was met with resistance and hostility. 

I had a verbal altercation with the same supervisor when she returned to the center after another four-month absence. She criticized me for not sitting next to my child during breakfast, despite there being no available seat next to her. I felt disrespected and went to the director to request that we be kept in separate quarters. Unfortunately, this request was not honored. 

Last week, during a meeting, she raised her voice at me when discussing my points. I tried to remain calm and non-confrontational, but she accused me of being disrespectful when I checked my phone for a moment. I was shocked and decided to remove myself from the conversation. Despite the ongoing issues, I continue to work with her.
Interviewer: 
That sounds incredibly challenging. I'm curious, do you have any theories as to why the culture at your workplace is so dysfunctional? There are many red flags in your story. Do you have any insights into what's happening at the top level?

RBT: 
To be honest, I'm not sure. With my supervisor, I believe it's because she's a black woman and feels she has to put on a certain armor. She identifies as a black BCBA, which is a minority in our field. She once pulled me and the other black women in the office aside for a talk, which made me uncomfortable. It felt like she was singling us out, making us seem like angry individuals, which we are not. I felt she was trying to manipulate the situation based on our shared ethnicity, which I didn't appreciate. Prior to this, I never had any issues with BCBAs at my previous center. But with her, I felt like I was constantly on edge.
Interviewer: 
That's quite a story. I'm sorry to hear about your experiences, but I'm impressed that you're persevering. In the next section, I'd like to ask about your training as an RBT. Considering both the training and education provided by the BACB and your first supervisor, do you feel your training prepared you well for your first day working with clients?

RBT: 
Yes, the 40-hour training was beneficial. I learned a lot of things I didn't know before. However, I'm a person who learns 50% electronically and 50% hands-on. I was grateful to have hands-on BCBAs at my first center because they taught me a lot, including minor corrections. 

One of them was the center manager, who was also a BCBA. When I started working with a child who cried a lot, she provided guidance. During my first two months there, I was still adjusting. Every time the child arrived at the center, he would cry, and I didn't understand why. Eventually, he grew out of it and started greeting me cheerfully. 

One morning, I was having a rough day and was visibly upset. She pulled me aside an hour later and advised me to keep my frustrations internal. At the time, I was upset and didn't take her advice well. However, I didn't argue with her. After reflecting on it, I realized she was right. Sometimes, you have to correct yourself. I appreciated her guidance.
Interviewer: 
I've heard from many IBTs who didn't receive hands-on training initially, and it seems they suffered for it. It's impressive that you had someone to guide and correct you, not just in terminology but in practical client interaction. If you could redesign the training requirements for new RBTs, what changes would you implement?

RBT: 
Honestly, I would incorporate more hands-on training. I understand that every scenario and company is different. My first company conducted shadow sessions before we started working with the children. I would continue this practice but make it broader. When you're tested for RBT certification, you're not alone. I believe that if the people I tested with didn't receive that training, we should have a training center wherever ABA is practiced. This would allow for more hands-on and shadow sessions. Parents could sign a consent form indicating they're comfortable with their child being in a place where RBTs are being trained. I think this would be very important and make a significant difference. I've met RBTs who didn't receive the same training as I did, and they need those corrections that I had. I don't want to correct them, but I wish there was someone there for them like there was for me when I needed it.
Interviewer: 
I'm really interested in your answer to that question. I've heard from many RBTs and I've been shocked. My team and I have been surprised by the responses to our questions about training. It's rare to find someone who feels they were trained effectively and prepared from day one to work with kids who might not be able to communicate or engage. Very few people say they felt like that. It seems like there are some structural issues. I'm interested to get your take on that. You've covered a lot of my questions, which is great. So, did the training you received from the BACB or your first BCBA address the potential for harm or abuse in ABA therapy? Did they ever discuss the ways that ABA can go wrong or could lead to clients being harmed?

RBT: 
With my first company, yes. I did have to actually have hands-on experience with a child to fully understand what they meant. But they provided thorough descriptions and training. They provided notes if we needed them, even in central reach. With some of those kids, you definitely needed a few notes. They did a great job with it.
Interviewer: 
That's fantastic to hear. I'm definitely interested to hear what sort of things they did. So what sort of descriptions and notes were they giving you?

RBT: 
Let's see. I'll use my most aggressive client, Ben, as an example. In his central route section, it would detail the behavior he had and how bad it could get. Then, it would provide instructions on what to do. If one approach didn't work, it would suggest another, and so on. If we needed help, we could call for it. 

One day, Ben was very aggressive. He flipped a table and I ended up with big scratches across my face. At the time, I was CPR certified, but I had never had to do a hold. I didn't want to do anything that could possibly hurt him. So, I called my BCBA. She came in and showed me how to hold him in a way that wouldn't hurt him. After that, whenever he would get really aggressive, I would use that hold.

Interviewer: 
So how would you hold him?

RBT: 
He would sit between my legs, but I wouldn't cross my legs over him. I would let him kick because his legs weren't long and they weren't going anywhere. We would be on a padded floor, on a mat specifically for him. So when he did kick, his foot didn't hit a hard floor. I would just hold his arms by his side, applying just enough pressure so he couldn't overpower me. Eventually, he would calm down and we would engage in counting shapes.
Interviewer: 
I'm trying to imagine what would happen if there wasn't someone at your clinic who knew how to handle such situations. You were just talking about the first company. Can you now discuss the second company? Specifically, did they ever discuss the ways that ABA can go wrong and potentially harm clients? And perhaps even harm the RBTs?

RBT: 
Can I have about 30 seconds to think?

Interviewer: 
Of course, take your time. 

RBT: 
Thank you. Regarding the second company, I regret to say that the training was inadequate, particularly when it came to handling children's behaviors. Each child is unique, especially at this center. The child I work with exhibits behaviors such as kicking, hitting the table, screaming, and even running into objects and hitting them with the back of her hand. I'm not sure why she does that. 

There's another child at the center whose behaviors are even more extreme. I haven't worked with him directly, but his situation often requires physical removal from rooms. Sometimes, he even tries to run out of the center. Unfortunately, I wasn't properly trained on how to handle her behaviors, and the RBTs working with him were definitely not adequately trained for his behaviors.
Interviewer: 
Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? Why do you say that?

RBT: 
When I first started at this center, there was a child who would exhibit disruptive behaviors, and the staff would just let him be. His actions were interrupting other children during group activities. There was also another nonverbal child who didn't like noise, and he would become upset when the first child started screaming. The staff member I spoke to about this didn't know what to do. She had been at the center for three years and had worked with the disruptive child for the same amount of time, but she was never trained on how to handle his behaviors or how to remove him from the room if necessary.

As for the child I work with, I wasn't given any guidance on how to handle her behaviors. I had to figure out what works for her on my own. I think it's unfortunate because she's been at the center for years, and there should be notes or some form of guidance on how to handle her behaviors. Now, RBTs who have been at the center longer than I have come to me for advice on how to calm her down. It's strange because I've only been here since January.
Interviewer: 
That's fine. Please take your time. I understand that our time is limited, but I hope you can spare an extra ten minutes. I feel like you have a lot to share, and I'm genuinely interested. I've already learned a lot in the last 45 minutes. So, if we can continue for another 10 minutes, that would be great. However, if you need to leave, that's perfectly fine.

RBT: 
It was just a non-factor. It momentarily threw me off.
Interviewer: 
Do you think the circumstances could be dangerous, either for the RBTs or for the clients?

RBT: 
Yes, I do believe there could be danger. For instance, one of the kids I work with has a tendency to run away. He's done it at home, even leaving in the middle of the night to go to the fire station. The last time he ran away, he ended up with a nail in his foot. I'm concerned that if he runs while the RBT is occupied, for example cleaning up a mess, he could get far away before anyone notices. 

I'm also concerned about the safety of another child I work with. She doesn't harm herself, but she does have some self-regulatory behaviors. She'll smack the table or pick at a bruise on her skin. My concern for her is more about the director at our center. He's very aggressive with the children, to the point where they're afraid of him. One of our verbal clients will literally turn away from him in fear. 

The child I work with gets upset when her regular RBTs aren't with her and she's left with the director. She cries immediately upon seeing him. Instead of waiting for her to calm down before starting a session, he exacerbates the situation. For example, he'll demand she remove her tokens while she's crying, even though she probably can't hear him. 

He also doesn't respect her response time. She has a 10-second delay, meaning she needs 10 seconds to respond to a prompt. But he only gives her two seconds before moving on. If she's already upset and picking at her skin, and he presents a prompt, he'll snap at her if she doesn't respond immediately. 

I have a video of this behavior, recorded by a coworker. We reported it, but haven't heard much back. Since we're a private company, there's not much that can be done.
Interviewer: 
My next question is, if you're observing this, which sounds quite terrible, what are you supposed to do when you're working in a place where someone is treating a disabled child this way? Who did you report it to?

RBT: 
I reported it to a site, which I don't want to mislabel as a child abuse site, but...

Interviewer: 
Child Protective Services?

RBT: 
Yes, that's the one. I reached out to my previous BCBA to get the site because I couldn't directly report it to the director. I haven't heard anything back after reporting, so I'm unsure of what will happen next.

Interviewer: 
I'm really sorry to hear you're dealing with this. But I'm also very glad to hear that you are in that clinic. I've heard stories as bad as this and even worse, where there was no one to report it. Are you still working there? I'm sorry you're working under such circumstances. It's clear why the children are terrified of this director. So, when a child is exhibiting these behaviors, maybe even escalating their self-injurious behaviors, they're still trying to conduct trials. Is that correct? And is this the same clinic where you mentioned there were about 64 targets?

RBT: 
Yes, it's the same clinic and the same child.
Interviewer: 
Is it the same child? I've begun to wonder, hearing these stories, if some of the children's behavior is a reaction to the therapy itself. Could it be driving them to escalate and causing distress? What's your take on this? I've never been in one of these clinics, but I've spoken to many RBTs and heard their stories. I find myself thinking that perhaps some of the behaviors they describe, like escalating self-injurious behaviors, extreme tantrums, and uncontrollable crying, might be the child's response to the therapy. They're conducting Discrete Trial Training (DTT) and it's just trial after trial. It seems to me that the child might be signaling a need for a break. Do you ever feel that the therapy might be delivered in a way that exacerbates these problems?

RBT: 
I've actually had a child who needed a break. We gave him one, but we also had to discuss it with his mother. He was receiving speech and occupational therapy in addition to ABA, which was a lot for a four-year-old. I suggested they take him on vacation, let him experience simple things like feeling the sun or touching sand. They're still children, they get tired and worn out just like everyone else. It's like a job to them. So yes, I believe they should be given breaks.
Interviewer: 
Alright, I'm mindful of the time, and I want to get as much from you as I can. Let's move on to my next section. You've shared a lot of interesting information, and I'm grateful for it. I'm interested in discussing stimming behaviors. Do you ever work on these behaviors, or have you observed other RBTs working on them?

RBT: 
I have indeed worked with many children who exhibit stimming behaviors. Personally, I find it one of the most rewarding aspects of being an RBT. I genuinely enjoy observing children stim. I recall one child in particular, whose mother I still keep in touch with. He had unique stims, which involved him walking up to you, smiling, and then returning to what he was doing. I would always check if he needed anything, but he was just content with his stimming. I found it endearing, so I think it's quite cute.
Interviewer: 
Do any of your colleagues or people at the clinics you work with try to alter children's stimming behavior? Do they attempt to suppress it or teach the children to control it in different circumstances? Perhaps they have a different perspective on it than you do?

RBT: 
To my knowledge, I can't recall any instances of this. Perhaps it's because the stimming behaviors aren't very pronounced?

Interviewer: 
I apologize if I interrupted you.

RBT: 
No, it's fine. I haven't observed it yet.

Interviewer: 
As I've delved deeper into ABA, I've also listened to autistic individuals who underwent the treatment as children and are now reflecting on it as adults. A common theme is ABA therapists trying to train them to stop stimming. They argue that this is harmful because stimming helps them calm down and concentrate. So, when I speak to RBTs now, I ask them how they respond to these perspectives. I must admit, I don't think anyone on my team has met anyone who appreciates stimming. I'm seeing more and more examples of this as I speak to more RBTs. I wish we had more time to discuss this.

RBT: 
I have a question. I noticed the site allows you to book different times on different days. Are there different interview slots available?
Interviewer: 
Just give me one moment. I have someone in the waiting room and I need to send them a message so they don't leave.

RBT: 
Message

Interviewer: 
Okay, could you repeat your question for me?

RBT: 
When I looked at the site, I saw that it allows you to book different times. I believe I received an email about this yesterday. I booked for today and tomorrow. Is this feature for students?
Interviewer: 
I'm supervising the whole process. My students would love to talk to you more. I would also appreciate if you could chat with me a bit more. However, let's conclude this interview first. I need to read you some information and ask for your permission on a few things. After that, we can continue our conversation via email. If you're interested in meeting one of my students, that's absolutely fine. But let's wrap up this interview first as I have another person to talk to. I would like to address any questions you have, but we're running short on time. I want to ask if you're comfortable with my team sharing an anonymized transcript of today's interview with other interested parties, like researchers at my institution. To be clear, this would never include any details that could identify you. If you accidentally say something that might give away your work, we will review the transcripts again to ensure your privacy. Is that okay with you?

RBT: 
Yes, that's fine.

Interviewer: 
Great. And what about the audio recording? Are you okay with that?

RBT: 
Yes, I am.

Interviewer: 
Please feel free to say no if you're not comfortable.

RBT: 
No, I promise it's okay. I actually enjoy things like this. When it came up, I saw it as a nice opportunity. So yes, it's perfectly fine.
Interviewer: 
Thank you so much for your time. If you wish to continue this conversation, I have more questions for you. Please send us an email, and I'll arrange a suitable time for us to talk. I appreciate your contribution to this project. I'll be on the lookout for your email. Even if I don't see it in the fall, when we prepare our report, I'll share it with you. If you have any thoughts or reflections on it, I'd love to hear them. Perhaps we can talk again at that point, if not sooner. Thank you again for your time.

RBT: 
You're welcome. Thank you. Goodbye.
