Interviewer: 
To confirm, you're comfortable with me recording this interview?

RBT: 
Yes. 

Interviewer: 
Thank you. Let's start with some background questions before we delve deeper. What state are you currently working in?

RBT: 
I'm currently working in Jacksonville, Florida.

Interviewer: 
What is the highest level of education you've achieved?

RBT: 
I have my high school diploma and I'm nine classes away from completing my bachelor's in social work. I expect to finish in about a year.

Interviewer: 
I'm interested in discussing that further. But first, how many years have you been working with clients?

RBT: 
I've been working with clients for about a year and a half. I didn't know about the RBT role until 2022. I found the job posting on Indeed and that's where I received most of my training.

Interviewer: 
I'm eager to hear about your journey into ABA. Where have you delivered therapy - at home, in a clinic, or at school?

RBT: 
I've conducted one in-home session. All other sessions have been at the center.
Interviewer: 
I'm definitely curious about what happened.

RBT: 
I had a client who I absolutely loved. He was one of my favorite clients, very smart. I genuinely enjoyed working with him, even though the distance from the center to his home was quite far. I enjoyed the drive because I knew I would have a great time at his house. However, he graduated out of the program, and I was left without a client. I wouldn't say that I didn't want another home-based client, but I've become more selective. After him, I decided to stay at the center.

Interviewer: 
I've heard from other RBTs about the challenges of driving around, especially when a client cancels, and they lose money on gas without being able to make up the hours. It sounds difficult. Currently, you hold an RBT credential from the BACB. Do you have any plans to become a BCBA?

RBT: 
Right now, I wouldn't say no. I've met some great BCBAs, and they've been motivating. However, it's not currently in my plans. I'm interested in mental health therapy and adoption counseling. My mind might change next year, so it's a possibility, but not a certainty.
Interviewer: 
I'm curious about your interest in adoption counseling. I've never heard anyone talk about it before. What led you to this field?

RBT: 
Originally, I wanted to major in psychology before I left high school. I started at Savannah State, which didn't offer psychology, only social work. After researching, I realized social work offered many opportunities. During my freshman year, I had a class with a professor named Loach. We watched a video about a young boy on Netflix. I'm not entirely sure, but I think his name was Banik. We analyzed the video and wrote projects on it. It touched me deeply because I knew kids growing up who didn't have the best home environment. My goal is to help place these children not just in a place where they're loved, but also where they'll be well taken care of. I'm aware that not all adoptive families provide the best environment, so I'm very focused on ensuring children have a good start in life.
Interviewer: 
That's amazing. I can't imagine how incredibly important that decision is for a child's whole life. It's wonderful that you're going to make such a big difference. Thank you for answering the background questions. We're very interested in whether RBTs are paid fairly for their work and if they're treated well. Would you mind sharing what your starting salary was in your very first position as an RBT?

RBT: 
I'm a very open person, so I don't mind discussing it. I started off earning $16 an hour as an RBT. Initially, I was a behavior tech before I got my credential. After receiving my credential, I got a 25 cent raise, so my wage was $16.25. I stayed at this rate for about seven to eight months. Eventually, I spoke up about the low pay and got a raise to $18 an hour. However, the first company I worked for didn't offer enough hours to match the pay, making it difficult to pay bills and a car note. So, I ended up leaving. Currently, I earn $20.50 an hour. The hours are still not sufficient, so it's a bit challenging, but it's a significant improvement.
Interviewer: 
When you were earning $16.25, did you receive health insurance? 

RBT: 
No, I did not.

Interviewer: 
Are you currently receiving health insurance from your work?

RBT: 
No, I am not.

Interviewer: 
How many hours a week do you work in total, considering all of the clients that you're seeing?

RBT: 
With my first company, I was working around 40 to 45 hours every two weeks. Sometimes, it was only 20 to 25 hours. Now, I work about 30 hours a week.

Interviewer: 
How many hours per week do you work with an average client?

RBT: 
With the first company, I worked with one client for about 15 hours a week.

Interviewer: 
What about with your current company?

RBT: 
It's a bit easier now. I work with two children. On Monday and Tuesday, I have one child, on Wednesday and Thursday, I have another, and then on Friday, I go back to the first child. So, I work with one child for about 15 hours a week and the other for about 10 hours a week.
Interviewer: 
Are there other therapists also working with these children? Could they be receiving around 20 to 30 hours of therapy a week? You mentioned having a caseload of four clients at your first job. That seems quite substantial. Did that present any challenges? Would you like to discuss that?

RBT: 
Honestly, it was often very draining. Despite having a large caseload, there were frequent cancellations due to the children falling ill. It was challenging to start my day with my first two clients, only to have the third one cancel. It was indeed very frustrating. I was brought to tears more times than I can recall. However, my deep appreciation for the children made everything better. I stayed at that job for 10 months, primarily because of them. I still regret leaving them to this day.
Interviewer: 
It sounds like you really connect with your kids, especially the first one you spent home time with. That seems like a real challenge. Moving on to a less personal question, I'm curious about the average duration of treatment at a clinic. From when they start at the clinic to when they graduate, is it in months or years? How long does the average treatment program take?

RBT: 
If we're starting from the very beginning, as I've done with some kids, we were always taught in training that the maximum duration is three years. I'm not sure what other RBTs were told, but most children are able to meet the standards and reach their goals within that three-year mark, and then they graduate and go on to school. However, it also depends on where they start and how old they are. I started with a one and a half year old whose treatment plan was planned out for three years. I also started with a seven year old who completed her program within two months.

Interviewer: 
What did she achieve after two months that made people think she was ready to leave?

RBT: 
She started off with very few words, but by the time I finished working with her, she was making full sentences. She was talking to me as if we were best friends and had known each other for five years. She was a very functional child. The tasks and targets we had set for her were met so quickly that it was clear she didn't need to be here anymore. She needed to be somewhere that could meet her where she was and push her to where she needed to be, because we didn't feel we could do that anymore.
Interviewer: 
That must be a good feeling. You mentioned that you've been there for 10 months, and you only stay that long because of your clients. How many years do RBTs typically stay on in the clinic? We've been hearing a lot about burnout and turnover.

RBT: 
The duration of stay really depends on how dedicated you are to the field. For instance, I started working with a colleague who had already been an RBT for five years. Now, a year later, she's in her sixth year and she loves it. She has no plans to leave, even if she goes back to get her bachelor's degree. She doesn't want to become a BCBA, she's content where she is. However, I also know someone who only stayed for six months. So, it really depends on your dedication to the field.

Interviewer: 
Do you have a sense of what's more common? Is it more common to stay for six months or six years?

RBT: 
It's more common to stay for six years. It's very rare that I see someone leave after just a few months.
Interviewer: 
That's good to hear. So, for an average, would you say I could put down two or three years? 

RBT: 
I would say three years. 

Interviewer: 
Alright. Would you say that the level of staff turnover and burnout is concerning?

RBT: 
Yes, it is. 

Interviewer: 
Could you elaborate on that?

RBT: 
At the previous center where I worked, we were understaffed at one point. We managed to increase our staff, but then we lost our center manager. Without a city manager, we were short staffed again. Then we lost one of our BCBAs. We had two BCBAs for over 15 kids and only about four RBTs.

Interviewer: 
Wow, that sounds challenging. 

RBT: 
It was. It was concerning because the kids weren't getting what they needed. I'm passionate about their progress. The most concerning part for me always reverts back to the kids.
Interviewer: 
It's clear that you're most concerned about the kids. I'm sure it was hard for everyone involved. Could you elaborate on the issues you found most concerning with the kids? You mentioned some regression.

RBT: 
Yes, there was regression. Parents also played a significant role. I worked with a child who didn't have a morning RBT, and I was the new RBT. I worked from 12 to three. His mother was very involved, which I appreciated, but she was constantly emailing and texting about her son's progress. I felt helpless because there was nothing I could do. If I could have taken him for that morning session, I would have, but it wasn't possible. So, the parents were a significant factor.

RBT: 
In my current job, if a therapist is out, the child can still be in the center. However, about two and a half weeks ago, there were only two RBTs in the center for seven kids. Most of these children have major behavioral issues. So, imagine four of them with major behaviors and only two of us to manage. The other three kids were upset by the noise and chaos. That was probably the most stress I've ever experienced.

Interviewer: 
I can't even imagine.

RBT: 
I questioned whether this was the right job for me. But I stuck it out. However, I knew it wasn't right. They shouldn't be overworking me if they're not willing to pay me accordingly.
Interviewer: 
You mentioned there were only two RBTs for seven kids, with major behavioral issues. I assume you mean things like self-injurious behaviors, or escape behaviors. There must be concerns about the kids as well. It seems unfair to the RBTs. But let's step back a bit. Do you feel respected at your current clinic?

RBT: 
Absolutely not. I am not respected.

Interviewer: 
How does that manifest?

RBT: 
Well, I won't say it's everyone. I love the parents and the kids. But management is terrible. Currently, in Jacksonville, there aren't many places to go. So I have to stick it out where I am to pay my bills.
Interviewer: 
What sort of problems have you had with management?

RBT: 
When I first started, I was warned about the second BCBA. There are two BCBAs, eight children, and six RBTs. We lost one RBT on Monday and we're losing another one tomorrow. The second BCBA hadn't been seen for months and wasn't providing supervision, which concerned me as it could risk my credentials. When I met her, she was standoffish and seemed to favor one RBT. If I approached her with a question, she would dismiss me. 

I was assigned a child with 76 targets on our program, which was overwhelming. I was expected to run 76 targets 10 trials a day, which was too much. I requested a meeting in the group chat to discuss my concerns, but was met with resistance and hostility. 

I was labeled unprofessional for raising issues that I knew were wrong. I had another verbal altercation with the same supervisor. She came to the center after another four months of absence and criticized me for not sitting next to my child while she was eating breakfast. I felt disrespected and asked the director to keep us in separate quarters, but he didn't follow through. 

Last week, during a meeting, she raised her voice at me when discussing my points. I tried to remain calm and non-confrontational, but she accused me of being disrespectful when I checked my phone. I was shocked and decided to remove myself from the conversation. I pointed out that others were also on their phones during the meeting, but she denied it. After that, I didn't say anything else to her. However, when I decided to leave, something happened.
Interviewer: 
That sounds incredibly challenging. I'm curious, do you have any theories as to why the culture at your workplace is so dysfunctional? There are many red flags in your story. Do you have any insights into what's happening at the top level?

RBT: 
To be honest, I'm not sure. With her, I believe it's because she's a black woman and feels the need to put on a certain persona. She identifies as the black BCBA, which is a rarity in our field. However, it's not necessary. One day, she pulled all the black women in the office aside for a chat. I found this uncomfortable and felt singled out. I'm not an angry person, but her actions made me feel as if I was being portrayed as one. She was trying to create a narrative that didn't exist, and I didn't appreciate it. Prior to this, I had no issues with BCBAs at my previous center. But with her, I felt like I was walking on eggshells.
Interviewer: 
That's quite a story. I'm sorry to hear about your experiences, but I'm impressed that you're persevering. In the next section, I want to discuss your training as an RBT. Considering both the training and education provided by the BACB and your first supervisor, do you feel that your training adequately prepared you for your first day working with clients?

RBT: 
Yes, the 40-hour training was beneficial. I learned a lot of things I didn't know before. However, I'm a person who learns 50% electronically and 50% hands-on. I was grateful to have hands-on BCBAs at my first center because they taught me a lot, including minor corrections. 

One of them was the center manager, who was also a BCBA. When I started working with a child who cried a lot, she was there to guide me. This was during my first two months at the center, and I was still getting used to things. Every time the child arrived at the center, he would cry, and I didn't understand why. Eventually, he grew out of it and started greeting me cheerfully. 

One morning, I was having a rough day and was visibly upset. She pulled me aside an hour later and advised me to keep my frustrations to myself. At the time, I was still upset and didn't take her advice well. However, I didn't argue with her. I took her advice to heart and realized she was right. Sometimes, you have to correct yourself. I appreciated her guidance.
Interviewer: 
I've heard from many IBTs who didn't receive hands-on training initially, and they certainly felt the impact of that. It's impressive that you had someone to guide and correct you, not just in terms of terminology, but also in how to work with clients. If you were in charge of the BACB and could redesign the training requirements, what changes would you implement?

RBT: 
Honestly, I would incorporate more hands-on training. I understand that every scenario and company is different. My first company conducted shadow sessions before we started working with children. I would continue that practice but make it broader. When you're tested for RBT, you're not alone. I believe that if the people I tested with didn't receive that training, we should have a training center wherever ABA is practiced. This would allow for more hands-on and shadow sessions. Parents could sign a consent form indicating they're comfortable with their child being in a place where RBTs are being trained. I think this would be very important and make a big difference. I've met RBTs who didn't receive the same training as I did, and they need those corrections that I had. I don't want to correct them, but I wish there was someone there for them like there was for me when I needed it.
Interviewer: 
I'm really interested in your answer to that question. I've heard from many RBTs and it's rare to find someone who feels they were trained effectively from day one to work with kids who might not be able to communicate or might engage. It seems like there are some structural issues. So, did the training that you received either from the BACB or from your first BCBA address the potential for harm or abuse in ABA therapy? Do they ever discuss the ways that ABA can go wrong or could lead to clients being harmed?

RBT: 
With my first company, yes. I did have to actually gain experience with a child to fully understand what they meant. But they definitely provided thorough descriptions and training. We had notes if we needed them, even in central reach. With some of those kids, you definitely needed a few notes. They did a great job with it.
Interviewer: 
That's fantastic to hear. I'm definitely interested to hear what sort of things they did. So what sort of descriptions and notes were they giving you?

RBT: 
Let's see. I'll use my most aggressive client, Ben, as an example. In his central route section, it would detail the behavior that he had and how bad it could get. Then, it would provide instructions on what to do. If one approach didn't work, it would suggest another, and so on. If we needed help, we could refer to these notes. 

One day, Ben was very aggressive. He flipped a table and I ended up with scratches across my face. Despite being CPR certified, I had never had to do a hold with any of my clients before. I was hesitant to do anything that could potentially hurt him. So, I called my BCBA. She came in and demonstrated a hold that wouldn't hurt him. It was different because he was smaller. After that, whenever he would become aggressive, I would use that hold.

Interviewer: 
So how would you hold him?

RBT: 
He would sit between my legs, but I wouldn't cross my legs over him. I would let him kick, as his legs weren't long and wouldn't reach far. We would be on a padded floor, with a mat specifically for him. When he kicked, his foot wouldn't hit a hard floor. I would hold his arms by his side, applying just enough pressure so he couldn't overpower me. Eventually, he would realize he couldn't move, stop fighting, and we would start counting shapes together. It was surprising how well it worked.
Interviewer: 
I'm trying to imagine what would happen if there wasn't someone at your clinic who knew how to handle such situations. You were just talking about the first company. Can you now discuss the second company? Specifically, did they ever discuss the ways that ABA can go wrong and potentially harm clients or even RBTs?

RBT: 
Can I have about 30 seconds to think?

Interviewer: 
Of course, take your time. 

RBT: 
Thank you. Regarding the second company, I regret to say that the training was inadequate, particularly when it came to handling children's behaviors. Each child is unique, especially at this center. The child I work with exhibits behaviors such as kicking, hitting the table, screaming, and running into objects, hitting them with the back of her hand. I'm not sure why she does that. 

There's another child at the center whose behavior is even more extreme. I haven't worked with him directly, but his behavior often necessitates physical removal from rooms. Sometimes, he even tries to run out of the center. Unfortunately, I wasn't properly trained on how to handle her behaviors, and the RBTs working with him were definitely not adequately trained to manage his behaviors.
Interviewer: 
Do you want to tell me a bit more about that? Why do you say that?

RBT: 
When I first started at this center, there was a child who would often act out, and the staff would just let him be. His behavior was disruptive, especially during group activities. There was another nonverbal child who was sensitive to noise, and he would become upset when the first child started screaming. The staff member I spoke to about this didn't know how to handle the situation, despite having been there for three years and working with the disruptive child for the same amount of time. She had never been trained on how to manage his behavior or how to remove him from the room if necessary.

As for the child I work with, I wasn't given any guidance on how to handle her behaviors. I had to figure out what worked for her on my own. I find it disappointing because she's been at the center for years, and there should be notes or some form of guidance on how to manage her behavior. Now, RBTs who have been at the center longer than I have come to me for advice on how to calm her down. It's strange because I've only been there since January.
Interviewer: 
That's fine. Please take your time. I understand that we're running over time, but I hope you can spare an extra 10 minutes. I feel like you have a lot more to share, and I'm genuinely interested. I've already learned a lot in the last 45 minutes. So, if we can continue for another 10 minutes, that would be great. However, if you need to leave, that's perfectly fine.

RBT: 
It was just a non-factor. It just caught me off guard for a moment.
Interviewer: 
Do you think the circumstances could be dangerous, either for the RBTs or for the clients?

RBT: 
Yes, I do believe there could be danger. For instance, one of the kids I work with has a tendency to run away. He's done it at home, even leaving in the middle of the night to go to the fire station. Last time, he didn't make it all the way because he got a nail in his foot. I'm concerned about this, especially if the RBT is occupied with another task, like cleaning up. The child could be down the street before anyone notices. 

I'm also concerned about the safety of another child I work with. She doesn't harm herself, but she does have some self-regulatory behaviors. She'll smack the table or pick at a bruise on her skin. My concern with her is the director at our center. He's very aggressive with the children to the point where they're afraid of him. One of our verbal clients will literally turn the other way when she sees him. 

The child I work with gets upset when her regular RBTs aren't with her and it's just him. She cries immediately upon seeing him. Instead of waiting for her to calm down, he exacerbates the situation. For example, he'll demand she remove her tokens while she's crying. If she doesn't respond to a prompt quickly enough for his liking, he gets impatient. She has a 10-second delay in responding to prompts, but he only gives her two seconds. 

If she's already upset and picking at her skin, and he presents a prompt, she's not going to respond in time. He'll snap at her, which only makes things worse. I have a video of this behavior that a coworker sent me. We reported it, but I haven't heard anything back. Since it's a private company, there's not much that can be done.
Interviewer: 
My next question is, if you're observing this, which sounds quite terrible, what are you supposed to do when you're working in a place where someone is treating a disabled child this way? Who did you report it to?

RBT: 
I reported it to a site, which I don't want to mislabel as a child abuse site, but...

Interviewer: 
Child Protective Services?

RBT: 
Yes, that's the one. I reached out to my previous BCBA to get the contact because I couldn't directly report it to the director. I haven't heard anything back after reporting, so I'm unsure of what will happen next.

Interviewer: 
I'm really sorry to hear you're dealing with this. But I'm also very glad to hear that you are in that clinic. I've heard stories as bad as this and even worse, where there was no one to report it. Are you still working there? I'm sorry you're working under such circumstances. It's clear why the children are terrified of this director. So, when a child is exhibiting these behaviors, maybe even escalating their self-injurious behaviors, they're still trying to conduct trials. Is that correct? And is this the same clinic where you mentioned there were about 64 targets?

RBT: 
Yes, it's the same child.
Interviewer: 
Is it the same child? I've begun to wonder, hearing these stories, if some of the children's behavior is a reaction to the therapy itself. Could it be driving them to escalate and causing distress? What's your take on this? I've never been in one of these clinics, but I've spoken to many RBTs and heard their stories. I find myself thinking that perhaps some of the behaviors they describe, like increased self-injurious behaviors, extreme tantrums, and uncontrollable crying, might be the child's response to the therapy. They're conducting Discrete Trial Training (DTT) and it's just trial after trial. It seems to me that the child might be signaling a need for a break. Do you ever feel that the therapy might be delivered in a way that exacerbates these problems?

RBT: 
I've actually had a child who needed a break. We gave him one, but we also had to discuss it with his mother. He was receiving speech and occupational therapy in addition to ABA, which was a lot for a four-year-old. We suggested a vacation, some time to feel the sun and touch the sand. They're still children, they get tired and worn out just like everyone else. It's like a job to them. So yes, they definitely need breaks.
Interviewer: 
Alright, I'm glad to hear your insights. You're very perceptive, and I appreciate that. I'm mindful of the time, as I have another interview starting soon, but I want to get as much information from you as I can. You've shared a lot of interesting details, and I'm grateful for that. Now, I'd like to discuss stimming behaviors. Do you ever work on these behaviors, or have you observed other RBTs working on them?

RBT: 
I have actually worked with many children who stim. Personally, I find it one of the most rewarding aspects of being an RBT. I genuinely enjoy observing children stimming. For instance, I worked with a child who had unique stims. He would always just smile, stim, and then return to what he was doing. I would ask him if he needed anything, but he was just content with his stimming. I found it endearing, so I genuinely enjoy seeing it.
Interviewer: 
Do you know if any of your colleagues or people at the clinics you work with try to alter the children's stimming behavior? Or perhaps suppress it or teach them to control it in different circumstances? Are there people who have a different perspective on this than you?

RBT: 
To my knowledge, I haven't seen anyone working on altering stimming behavior. Perhaps it's because the stimming behaviors aren't severe.

Interviewer: 
I apologize for interrupting you earlier.

RBT: 
No problem. As I was saying, I haven't seen anyone working on this yet.

Interviewer: 
As I've delved deeper into ABA, I've also listened to autistic individuals who received the treatment as children and are now reflecting on it as adults. They often mention ABA therapists trying to train them to stop stimming. They explain that this is harmful because stimming helps them calm down and concentrate. So, when I talk to RBTs now, I ask them how they react to this. I must say, I don't think anyone on my team has met anyone who appreciates stimming. I'm seeing more and more examples of this as I talk to more RBTs. I wish we had more time to discuss this.

RBT: 
I have a question. I know the site allows you to book different times on different days. So, are there different interview slots available?
Interviewer: 
Please give me a moment. I have someone in the waiting room and I need to send them a message so they don't leave.

RBT: 
Message

Interviewer: 
Could you repeat your question, please?

RBT: 
When I looked at the site, I saw an email yesterday that allows you to book slots. For instance, today's slots are six and I think I booked for tomorrow. Is this for students?
Interviewer: 
Yes, I'm supervising the whole process. My students would certainly enjoy speaking with you more. I would also appreciate if you could spare some more time to chat with me. However, let's conclude this interview first. I need to read you some information and ask for your consent on a few matters. After that, we can continue our conversation via email. If you're interested in meeting one of my students, that's absolutely fine. But first, let's wrap up this interview as I have another person waiting to speak with me. I would like to address any questions you have, but we're running short on time. I need to ask if you're comfortable with my team sharing an anonymized transcript of today's interview with other interested parties, such as researchers at my institution. To be clear, this would never include any details that could identify you. If you accidentally mention something that could reveal your identity, we will ensure it's removed from the transcript. We take this matter very seriously. Are you okay with this?

RBT: 
Yes, that's fine.

Interviewer: 
Great. And what about the audio recording? Are you comfortable with us keeping it?

RBT: 
Yes, I am.

Interviewer: 
Please feel free to say no if you're not comfortable.

RBT: 
No, it's okay. I actually enjoy things like this. When the opportunity arose, I saw it as a nice chance. So yes, it's perfectly fine.
Interviewer:
Thank you so much for your time. If you wish to continue this conversation, I have more questions for you. Please send us an email, and I'll arrange a suitable time for us to talk. I appreciate your contribution to this project. I'll be on the lookout for your email. Even if I don't see it in the fall, I'll share our report with you. If you have any thoughts or reflections on it, I'd love to hear them. Perhaps we can talk again at that point, if not sooner. Thank you again for your time.

RBT:
You're welcome. Thank you. Goodbye.
