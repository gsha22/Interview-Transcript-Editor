 Interviewer: Okay, so just to confirm, you're happy for me to record this interview?

RBT: Yes.

Interviewer: All right, beautiful. So, in what state are you currently working?

RBT: I'm in Florida. I'm in Jacksonville.

Interviewer: And what is the highest level of education you've reached so far?

RBT: I have my high school diploma. I have nine more classes for my bachelor's in social work. So, I'll be getting my bachelor's in maybe a year or so.
 Interviewer: Do you have any hypothesis as to why this culture is so dysfunctional?
RBT: Honestly, I don't know. I think it has to do with her being a black woman. She feels like she has to put on an armor. She pulled me to the side one day and said she wanted to talk to all the black women in the office. That made me uncomfortable. I never had any issues with BCBAs at the previous center, but when I got to her I felt like she was going to put me in jail.
