# transcript_creator

What it does: 
Uses GPT-4 to edit raw transcripts, cleaning them up in whatever way the user prompts gpt to do. 

How to use it: 
Save the original transcripts to the content folder. Run botv2.py, and once it finishes you will find
your edited transcripts with the same name in a .txt file in the outputs folder. 

Do not use bot.py, it does not work.
