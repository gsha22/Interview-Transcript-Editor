# Trancription Editor

## Background

I worked with Professor Simon Cullen from Carnegie Mellon University to help address an issue pertaining to interview transcripts: How can we use a large language model to our advantage to automatically edit long text files, and in doing so save hours of time? 

Because GPT-4 had recently come out, he advised me to find a way to create a script that can "read" interview text files and edit them in a way that the user pleases. 

## How it Works 

The idea is fairly straightforward. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item hello
\end{itemize}
